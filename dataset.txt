Part IOld Testament
Book of GenesisChapter 1In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.2And  the  earth  was  void  and  empty,  anddarkness was upon the face of the deep; and thespirit of God moved over the waters.3And  God  said:  Be  light  made.   And  lightwas made.4And God saw the light that it was good; andhe divided the light from the darkness.5And he called the light Day, and the dark-ness Night; and there was evening and morningone day.6And  God  said:   Let  there  be  a  firmamentmade  amidst  the  waters:  and  let  it  divide  thewaters from the waters.7And  god  made  a  firmament,  and  dividedthe waters that were under the firmament, fromthose that were above the firmament, and it wasso.8And God called the firmament, Heaven; andthe evening and morning were the second day.9God also said; Let the waters that are underthe heaven, be gathered together into one place:and let the dry land appear.  And it was so done.10And God called the dry land, Earth; andthe  gathering  together  of  the  waters,  he  calledSeas.  And God saw that it was good.11And he said: let the earth bring forth greenherb,  and such as may seed,  and the fruit treeyielding fruit after its kind, which may have seedin itself upon the earth.  And it was so done.12And  the  earth  brought  forth  the  greenherb, and such as yieldeth seed according to itskind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seedeach  one  according  to  its  kind.   And  God  sawthat it was good.13And the evening and the morning were thethird day.14And  God  said:  Let  there  be  lights  madein  the  firmament  of  heaven,  to  divide  the  dayand the night, and let them be for signs, and forseasons, and for days and years:15To shine in the firmament of heaven, andto give light upon the earth, and it was so done.16And God made two great lights:  a greaterlight  to rule the  day;  and a  lesser  light to  rulethe night:  and The stars.17And he set them in the firmament of heavento shine upon the earth.18And to rule the day and the night, and todivide the light and the darkness.  And God sawthat it was good.19And  the  evening  and  morning  were  thefourth day.20God also said:  let the waters bring forththe  creeping  creature  having  life,  and  the  fowlthat may fly over the earth under the firmamentof heaven.21And  God  created  the  great  whales,  andevery  living  and  moving  creature,  which  thewaaters brought forth, according to their kinds,and every winged fowl according to its kind. AndGod saw that it was good.
4Book of Genesis22And he blessed them, saying:  Increase andmultiply, and fill the waters of the sea:  and letthe birds be multiplied upon the earth.23And the evening and morning were the fifthday.24And God said:  Let the earth bring forththe living creature in its kind, cattle and creepingthings, and beasts of the earth, according to theirkinds.  And it was so done.25And  God  made  the  beasts  of  the  earthaccording  to  their  kinds,  and  cattle,  and  everything that creepeth on the earth after its kind.And God saw that it was good.26And he said: Let us make man to our imageand likeness: and let him have dominion over thefishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and thebeasts, and the whole earth, and every creepingcreature that moveth upon the earth.27And God created man to his own image:to the image of God he created him:  male andfemale he created them.28And  God  blessed  them,  saying:  Increaseand multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it,and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowlsof  the  air,  and  all  living  creatures  that  moveupon the earth.29And  God  said:  Behold  I  have  given  youevery herb bearing seed upon the earth, and alltrees that have in themselves seed of their ownkind, to be your meat:30And to all beasts of the earth, and to everyfowl  of  the  air,  and  to  all  that  move  upon  theearth,  and wherein there is life,  that they mayhave to feed upon.  And it was so done.31And  God  saw  all  the  things  that  he  hadmade, and they were very good. And the eveningand morning were the sixth day.Chapter 2So the heavens and the earth were finished, andall the furniture of them.2And on the seventh day God ended his workwhich he had made: and he rested on the seventhday from all his work which he had done.3And he blessed the seventh day, and sancti-fied it:  because in it he had rested from all hiswork which God created and made.4These are the generations of the heaven andthe  earth,  when  they  were  created,  in  the  daythat  the  Lord  God  made  the  heaven  and  theearth:5And every plant of the field before it sprungup  in  the  earth,  and  every  herb  of  the  groundbefore it grew:  for the Lord God had not rainedupon the earth; and there was not a man to tillthe earth.6But a spring rose out of the earth, wateringall the surface of the earth.7And the Lord God formed man of the slimeof  the  earth:   and  breathed  into  his  face  thebreath of life, and man became a living soul.8And the Lord God had planted a paradise ofpleasure from the beginning:  wherein he placedman whom he had formed.9And  the  Lord  God  brought  forth  of  theground all manner of trees,  fair to behold,  andpleasant  to  eat  of:   the  tree  of  life  also  in  themidst of paradise:  and the tree of knowledge ofgood and evil.10And a river went out of the place of plea-sure to water paradise, which from thence is di-vided into four heads.11The name of the one is Phison:  that is itwhich compasseth all the land of Hevilath, wheregold groweth.12And  the  gold  of  that  land  is  very  good:there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.13And the name of the second river is Gehon:the  same  is  it  that  compasseth  all  the  land  ofEthiopia.14And the name of the third river is Tigris:the same passeth along by the Assyrians.  Andthe fourth river is Euphrates.15And the Lord God took man, and put himinto the paradise of pleasure, to dress it, and tokeep it.16And he commanded him, saying:  Of everytree of paradise thou shalt eat:17But of the tree of knowledge of good andevil, thou shalt not eat.  For in what day soeverthou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.18And the Lord God said:  It is not good forman  to  be  alone:  let  us  make  him  a  help  likeunto himself.19And  the  Lord  God  having  formed  out  ofthe  ground  all  the  beasts  of  the  earth,  and  allthe fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to seewhat he would call them:  for whatsoever Adamcalled any living creature the same is its name.20And  Adam  called  all  the  beasts  by  theirnames, and all the fowls of the air, and all thecattle of the field:  but for Adam there was notfound a helper like himself.21Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep uponAdam: and when he was fast asleep, he took oneof his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.22And the Lord God built the rib which hetook from Adam into a woman: and brought herto Adam.23And Adam said:  This now is bone of mybones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be calledwoman, because she was taken out of man.24Wherefore  a  man  shall  leave  father  andmother,  and  shall  cleave  to  his  wife:  and  theyshall be two in one flesh.25And they were both naked:  to wit, Adamand his wife:  and were not ashamed.Chapter 3Now the serpent was more subtle tha any of thebeasts  of  the  earth  which  the  Lord  God  hadmade.   And  he  said  to  the  woman:  Why  hathGod  commanded  you,  that  you  should  not  eatof every tree of paradise?2And the woman answered him,  saying:  Ofthe fruit of the trees that are in paradise we doeat:3But of the fruit of the tree which is in themidst of paradise, God hath commanded us thatwe should not eat; and that we should not touchit, lest perhaps we die.4And the serpent said to the woman: No, youshall not die the death.5For God doth know that in what day soeveryou shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened:and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.6And the woman saw that the tree was goodto  eat,  and  fair  to  the  eyes,  and  delightful  tobehold:  and  she  took  of  the  fruit  thereof,  anddid eat, and gave to her husband, who did eat.7And  the  eyes  of  them  both  were  opened:and when they perceived themselves to be naked,they sewed together fig leaves, and made them-selves aprons.8And when they heard the voice of the LordGod  walking  in  paradise  at  the  afternoon  air,Adam and his wife hid themselves from the faceof the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.9And the Lord God called Adam, and said tohim:  Where art thou?10And he said:  I heard thy voice in paradise;and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hidmyself.11And  he  said  to  him:  And  who  hath  toldthee that thou wast naked,  but that thou hasteaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee thatthou shouldst not eat?
6Book of Genesis12And Adam said:  The woman, whom thougavest me to be my companion, gave me of thetree, and I did eat.13And the Lord God said to the woman: Whyhast  thou  done  this?   And  she  answered:  Theserpent deceived me, and I did eat.14And the Lord God said to the serpent:  Be-cause thou hast done this thing, thou art cursedamong all cattle, and beasts of the earth:  uponthy  breast  shalt  thou  go,  and  earth  shalt  thoueat all the days of thy life.15I  will  put  enmities  between  thee  and  thewoman,  and  thy  seed  and  her  seed:   she  shallcursh thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for herheel.16To  the  woman  also  he  said:  I  will  multi-ply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions:  in sorrowshalt thou bring forth children,  and thou shaltbe under thy husband’s power, and he shall havedominion over thee.17And to Adam he said:  Because thou hasthearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eatenof the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thoushouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work:with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all thedays of thy life.18Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth tothee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat breadtill thou return to the earth out of which thouwast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thoushalt return.20And Adam called the name of his wife Eve:because she was the mother of all the living.21And the Lord God made for Adam and hiswife garments of skins, and clothed them.22And he said:  Behold Adam is become asone of us, knowing good and evil:  now thereforelest perhaps he put forth his hand and take alsoof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.23And the Lord God sent him out of the par-adise of pleasure, to till the earth from which hewas taken.24And he cast out Adam:  and placed beforethe paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flam-ing sword, turning every way, to keep the way ofthe tree of life.Chapter 4And  Adam  knew  Eve  his  wife;  who  conceivedand brought forth Cain, saying:  I have gotten aman through God.2And  again  she  brought  forth  his  brotherAbel.   And  Abel  was  a  shepherd,  and  Cain  ahusbandman.3And it came to pass after many days, thatCain offered,  of the fruits of the earth,  gifts tothe Lord.4Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock,and  of  their  fat:  and  the  Lord  had  respect  toAbel, and to his offerings.5But to Cain and his offerings he had no re-spect:  and  Cain  was  exceeding  angry,  and  hiscountenance fell.6And  the  Lord  said  to  him:  Why  art  thouangry?  and why is thy countenance fallen?7If thou do well, shalt thou not receive?  butif  ill,  shall  not  sin  forthwith  be  present  at  thedoor?  but the lust thereof shall be under thee,and thou shalt have dominion over it.8And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us goforth abroad.  And when they were in the field,Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slewhim.9And  the  Lord  said  to  Cain:  Where  is  thybrother  Abel?   And  he  answered:  I  know  not:am I my brother’s keeper?10And he said to him: What hast thou done?
Book of Genesis7the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me fromthe earth.11Now therefore cursed shalt thou be uponthe earth, which hath opened her mouth and re-cieved the blood of thy brother at thy hand.12When thou shalt till it,  it shall not yieldto thee its fruit:  a fugitive and a vagabond shaltthou be upon the earth.13And Cain said to the Lord:  My iniquity isgreater than that I may deserve pardon.14Behold thou dost cast me out this day fromthe face of the earth, and from thy face I shall behid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive onthe earth:  every one therefore that findeth me,shall kill me.15And  the  Lord  said  to  him:   No,  it  shallnot  so  be:  but  whosoever  shall  kill  Cain,  shallbe punished sevenfold.  And the Lord set a markupon Cain, that whosoever found him should notkill him.16And  Cain  went  out  from  the  face  of  theLord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at theeast side of Eden.17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived,and brought forth Henoch:  and he built a city,and called the name thereof by the name of hisson Henoch.18And  Henoch  begot  Irad,  and  Irad  be-got Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, andMathusael begot Lamech,19Who took two wives:  the name of the onewas Ada, and the name of the other Sella.20And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was thefather of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.21And his brother’s name was Jubal:  he wasthe father of them that play upon the harp andthe organs.22Sella  also  brought  forth  Tubalcain,  whowas  a  hammerer  and  artificer  in  every  work  ofbrass and iron.  And the sister of Tubalcain wasNoema.23And  Lamech  said  to  his  wives  Ada  andSella:  Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hear-ken to my speech:  for I have slain a man to thewounding of myself, and a stripling to my ownbruising.24Sevenfold  vengeance  shall  be  taken  forCain:  but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.25Adam  also  knew  his  wife  again:  and  shebrought forth a son,  and called his name Seth,saying:   God  hath  given  me  another  seed  forAbel, whom Cain slew.26But  to  Seth  also  was  born  a  son,  whomhe called Enos:  this man began to call upon thename of the Lord.Chapter 5This is the book of the generation of Adam.  Inthe day that God created man, he made him tothe likeness of God.2He  created  them  male  and  female;   andblessed  them:  and called  their name  Adam,  inthe day when they were created.3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years,and begot a son to his own image and likeness,and called his name Seth.4And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth,were eight hundred years: and he begot sons anddaughters.5And all the time that Adam lived, came tonine hundred and thirty years, and he died.6Seth also lived a hundred and five years, andbegot Enos.7And  Seth  lived  after  he  begot  Enos,  eighthundred  and  seven  years,  and  begot  sons  anddaughters.
8Book of Genesis8And all the days of Seth were nine hundredand twelve years, and he died.9And  Enos  lived  ninety  years,  and  begotCainan.10After  whose  birth  he  lived  eight  hundredand fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.11And all the days of Enos were nine hundredand five years, and he died.12And Cainan lived seventy years, and begotMalaleel.13And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel,eight  hundred  and  forty  years,  and  begot  sonsand daughters.14And all the days of Cainan were nine hun-dred and ten years, and he died.15And Malaleel lived sixty-five years and be-got Jared.16And  Malaleel  lived  after  he  begot  Jared,eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sonsand daughters.17And  all  the  days  of  Malaleel  were  eighthundred and ninety-five years, and he died.18And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-twoyears, and begot Henoch.19And  Jared  lived  after  he  begot  Henoch,eight hundred years, and begot sons and daugh-ters.20And all the days of Jared were nine hun-dred and sixty-two years, and he died.21And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and be-got Mathusala.22And Henoch walked with God:  and livedafter he begot Mathusala, three hundred years,and begot sons and daughters.23And all the days of Henoch were three hun-dred and sixty-five years.24And he walked with God, and was seen nomore:  because God took him.25And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.26And   Mathlusala   lived   after   he   begotLamech,  seven  hundred  and  eighty-two  years,and begot sons and daughters.27And  all  the  days  of  Mathusala  were  ninehundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.28And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.29And  he  called  his  name  Noe,   saying:This same shall comfort us from the works andlabours  of  our  hands  on  the  earth,  which  theLord hath cursed.30And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, fivehundred  and  ninety-five  years,  and  begot  sonsand daughters.31And all the days of Lamech came to sevenhundred  and  seventy-seven  years,  and  he  died.And Noe,  when he was five hundred years old,begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.Chapter 6And after that men began to be multiplied uponthe earth, and daughters were born to them,2The  sons  of  God  seeing  the  daughters  ofmen,  that  they  were  fair,  took  to  themselveswives of all which they chose.3And God said:  My spirit shall not remainin man for ever, because he is flesh, and his daysshall be a hundred and twenty years.4Now  giants  were  upon  the  earth  in  thosedays.  For after the sons of God went in to thedaughters of men,  and they brought forth chil-dren,  these  are  the  mighty  men  of  old,  men  ofrenown.5And God seeing that the wickedness of menwas great on the earth, and that all the thoughtof their heart was bent upon evil at all times,6It repented him that he had made man onthe earth.  And being touched inwardly with sor-
Book of Genesis9row of heart,7He  said:  I  will  destroy  man,  whom  I  havecreated,  from  the  face  of  the  earth,  from  maneven to beasts, from the creeping thing even tothe  fowls  of  the  air,  for  it  repenteth  me  that  Ihave made them.8But Noe found grace before the Lord.9These are the generations of Noe:  Noe wasa  just  and  perfect  man  in  his  generations,  hewalked with God.10And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, andJapheth.11And the earth was corrupted before God,and was filled with iniquity.12And  when  God  had  seen  that  the  earthwas corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its wayupon the earth),13He  said  to  Noe:   The  end  of  all  flesh  iscome before me, the earth is filled with iniquitythrough them, and I will destroy them with theearth.14Make thee an ark of timber planks:  thoushalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shaltpitch it within and without.15And thus shalt thou make it.  The lengthof  the  ark  shall  be  three  hundred  cubits:   thebreadth  of  it  fifty  cubits,  and  the  height  of  itthirty cubits.16Thou shalt make a window in the ark, andin a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it:  and thedoor of the ark thou shalt set in the side:  withlower, middle chambers, and third stories shaltthou make it.17Behold, I will bring the waters of a greatflood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, whereinis the breath of life under heaven. All things thatare in the earth shall be consumed.18And I will establish my covenant with thee,and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thysons,  and  thy  wife,  and  the  wives  of  thy  sonswith thee.19And  of  every  living  creature  of  all  flesh,thou shalt bring two of a sort into the ark, thatthey  may  live  with  thee:  of  the  male  sex,  andthe female.20Of  fowls  according  to  their  kind,  and  ofbeasts  in  their  kind,  and  of  every  thing  thatcreepeth on the earth according to its kind:  twoof every sort shall go in with thee, that they maylive.21Thou shalt take unto thee of all food thatmay be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee:and it shall be food for thee and them.22And  Noe  did  all  things  which  God  com-manded him.Chapter 7And the Lord said to him:  Go in, thou and allthy house, into the ark:  for thee I have seen justbefore me in this generation.2Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, themale and the female.3But of the beasts that are unclean two andtwo, the male and the female.  Of the fowls alsoof the air seven and seven, the male and the fe-male:  that seed may be saved upon the face ofthe whole earth.4For yet a while, and after seven days, I willrain upon the earth forty days and forty nights:and  I  will  destroy  every  substance  that  I  havemade, from the face of the earth.5And Noe did all things which the Lord hadcommanded him.6And he was six hundred years old, when thewaters of the flood overflowed the earth.7And Noe went in and his sons, his wife andthe wives of his sons with him into the ark, be-
10Book of Genesiscause of the waters of the flood.8And  of  beasts  clean  and  unclean,  and  offowls, and of every thing that moveth upon theearth,9Two and two went in to Noe into the ark,male  and  female,  as  the  Lord  had  commandedNoe.10And after the seven days were passed, thewaters of the flood overflowed the earth.11In the six hundredth year of the life of Noe,in the second month, in the seventeenth day ofthe  month,  all  the  fountains  of  the  great  deepwere  broken  up,  and  the  floodgates  of  heavenwere opened:12And the rain fell upon the earth forty daysand forty nights.13In  the  selfsame  day  Noe,  and  Sem,  andCham, and Japheth, his sons:  his wife, and thethree wives of his sons with them, went into theark.14They and every beast according to its kind,and all the cattle in their kind, and every thingthat  moveth  upon  the  earth,  according  to  itskind,  and  every  fowl  according  to  its  kind,  allbirds, and all that fly,15Went in to Noe into the ark, two and twoof all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.16And they that went in, went in male andfemale of all flesh, as God had commanded him:and the Lord shut him in on the outside.17And  the  flood  was  forty  days  upon  theearth:  and  the  waters  increased,  and  lifted  upthe ark on high from the earth.18For they overflowed exceedingly:  and filledall  on  the  face  of  the  earth:   and  the  ark  wascarried upon the waters.19And the waters prevailed beyond measureupon the earth:  and all the high mountains un-der the whole heaven were covered.20The  water  was  fifteen  cubits  higher  thanthe mountains which it covered.21And  all  flesh  was  destroyed  that  movedupon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle, andof beasts,  and of all creeping things that creepupon the earth:  and all men.22And all things wherein there is the breathof life on the earth, died.23And  he  destroyed  all  the  substance  thatwas  upon  the  earth,  from  man  even  to  beast,and the creeping things and fowls of the air: andthey  were  destroyed  from  the  earth:   and  Noeonly remained, and they that were with him inthe ark.24And the waters prevailed upon the earth ahundred and fifty days.Chapter 8And  God  remembered  Noe,  and  all  the  livingcreatures, and all the cattle which were with himin the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth,and the waters were abated:2The  fountains  also  of  the  deep,  and  thefloodgates of heaven, were shut up, and the rainfrom heaven was restrained.3And the waters returned from off the earthgoing and coming:  and they began to be abatedafter a hundred and fifty days.4And  the  ark  rested  in  the  seventh  month,the seven and twentieth day of the month, uponthe mountains of Armenia.5And the waters were going and decreasinguntil the tenth month:  for in the tenth month,the first day of the month, the tops of the moun-tains appeared.6And after that forty days were passed, Noeopening  the  window  of  the  ark,  which  he  hadmade, sent forth a raven:
Book of Genesis117Which went forth and did not return, till thewaters were dried up upon the earth.8He sent forth also a dove after him, to see ifthe waters had now ceased upon the face of theearth.9But  she  not  finding  where  her  foot  mightrest, returned to him into the ark: for the waterswere upon the whole earth:  and he put forth hishand, and caught her, and brought her into theark.10And  having  waited  yet  seven  other  days,he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.11And she came to him in the evening carry-ing a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, inher mouth.  Noe therefore understood that thewaters were ceased upon the earth.12And he stayed yet other seven days:  andhe sent forth the dove, which returned not anymore unto him.13Therefore  in  the  six  hundredth  and  firstyear, the first month, the first day of the month,the  waters  were  lessened  upon  the  earth,  andNoe opening the covering of the ark, looked, andsaw that the face of the earth was dried.14In the second month, the seven and twen-tieth day of the month, the earth was dried.15And God spoke to Noe, saying:16Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thysons and the wives of thy sons with thee.17All living things that are with thee of allflesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creep-ing things that creep upon the earth, bring outwith  thee,  and  go  ye  upon  the  earth:  increaseand multiply upon it.18So Noe went out, he and his sons:  his wife,and the wives of his sons with him.19And all living things, and cattle, and creep-ing things that creep upon the earth, accordingto their kinds went out of the ark.20And Noe built an altar unto the Lord:  andtaking  of  all  cattle  and  fowls  that  were  clean,offered holocausts upon the altar.21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, andsaid: I will no more curse the earth for the sake ofman:  for the imagination and thought of man’sheart are prone to evil from his youth:  thereforeI will no more destroy every living soul as I havedone.22All the days of the earth, seedtime and har-vest,  cold  and  heat,  summer  and  winter,  nightand day, shall not cease.Chapter 9And  God  blessed  Noe  and  his  sons.    And  hesaid to them:  Increase, and multiply, and fill theearth.2And let the fear and dread of you be uponall the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowlsof the air, and all that move upon the earth:  allthe fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.3And  every  thing  that  moveth,  and  livethshall be meat for you:  even as the green herbshave I delivered them all to you:4Saving that flesh with blood you shall noteat.5For I will require the blood of your lives atthe hand of every beast, and at the hand of man,at the hand of every man, and of his brother, willI require the life of man.6Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his bloodshall be shed:  for man was made to the image ofGod.7But increase you and multiply, and go uponthe earth and fill it.8Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sonswith him:
restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last wasfound imbedded in the hump.Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut through what inold times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round—you enter thepublic room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and suchold  wrinkled  planks  beneath,  that  you  would  almost  fancy  you  trod  some  old  craft’scockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked sofuriously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases,filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting fromthe further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude attempt at a rightwhale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, sowide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round withold decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursedJonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, fortheir money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true cylinderswithout—within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to acheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’goblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more; and so onto the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table,examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I sought the landlord, andtelling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his housewas full—not a bed unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haintno objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’,so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do so, it woulddepend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really had no otherplace for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wanderfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decentman’s blanket.“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper? Supper’ll be readydirectly.”I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery. At oneend a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over anddiligently working away at the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a shipunder full sail, but he didn’t make much headway, I thought.At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room. It wascold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but twodismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkeyjackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the farewas  of  the  most  substantial  kind—not  only  meat  and  potatoes,  but  dumplings;  goodheavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself
to these dumplings in a most direful manner.“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty.”“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”“Oh,  no,”  said  he,  looking  a  sort  of  diabolically  funny,  “the  harpooneer  is  a  darkcomplexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, andhe likes ‘em rare.”“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.I  could  not  help  it,  but  I  began  to  feel  suspicious  of  this  “dark  complexioned”harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleeptogether, he must undress and get into bed before I did.Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else todo with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord cried, “That’s theGrampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a three years’ voyage, anda full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in rolled awild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their headsmuffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles,they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, andthis was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake forthe whale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soonpoured them out brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, uponwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was asovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, orwhether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the arrantesttopers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemeddesirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon thewhole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once;and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though buta sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon alittle description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chestlike a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brownand burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows ofhis eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice atonce announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must beone of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelryof his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I sawno more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was
missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them,they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s Bulkington?” and darted out of thehouse in pursuit of him.It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet afterthese orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me justprevious to the entrance of the seamen.No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleepwith your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but people like to be private when they aresleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in astrange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply.Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more thananybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, andcover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.The  more  I  pondered  over  this  harpooneer,  the  more  I  abominated  the  thought  ofsleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, asthe case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began totwitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be homeand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how couldI tell from what vile hole he had been coming?“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep with him. I’lltry the bench here.”“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it’s aplaguy  rough  board  here”—feeling  of  the  knots  and  notches.  “But  wait  a  bit,Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make yesnug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief firstdusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like anape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against anindestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’ssake to quit—the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planingin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings withanother grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he wentabout his business, and left me in a brown study.I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but thatcould be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in theroom was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. Ithen placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leavinga little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there camesuch a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan wouldnever do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from thewindow, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinityof the spot where I had thought to spend the night.The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal a march on him—
bolt  his  door  inside,  and  jump  into  his  bed,  not  to  be  wakened  by  the  most  violentknockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who couldtell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer mightbe standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferablenight  unless  in  some  other  person’s  bed,  I  began  to  think  that  after  all  I  might  becherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll waitawhile; he must be dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhapswe may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going tobed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such late hours?” Itwas now hard upon twelve o’clock.The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled atsomething beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night hewent out a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, maybe, he can’t sell his head.”“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?”getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer isactually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling hishead around this town?”“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t sell it here, themarket’s overstocked.”“With what?” shouted I.“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better stop spinning that yarnto me—I’m not green.”“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther guess you’ll bedone brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’ his head.”“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountablefarrago of the landlord’s.“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.“Broke,” said I—“broke, do you mean?”“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord,stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay. I cometo your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the otherhalf belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yetseen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to
beget  in  me  an  uncomfortable  feeling  towards  the  man  whom  you  design  for  mybedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in thehighest  degree.  I  now  demand  of  you  to  speak  out  and  tell  me  who  and  what  thisharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. Andin the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which iftrue I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea ofsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induceme to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long sarmon for a chapthat rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ‘balmed NewZealand heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ‘em but one, and that one he’strying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin’ humanheads about the streets when folks is goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but Istopped him just as he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for allthe airth like a string of inions.”This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that thelandlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time what could I thinkof a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engagedin such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful late, you hadbetter be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we werespliced. There’s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bedthat. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it.But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on thefloor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come alonghere, I’ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towardsme, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner,he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that harpooneer to-night; he’s come toanchor somewhere—come along then; do come; won’t ye come?”I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into asmall room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost bigenough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did doubleduty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make yourself comfortable now, and goodnight to ye.” I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant,it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides thebedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rudeshelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Ofthings not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrownupon  the  floor  in  one  corner;  also  a  large  seaman’s  bag,  containing  the  harpooneer’s
wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bonefish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of thebed.But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, andsmelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerningit. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with littletinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. Therewas a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South Americanponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and itweighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought alittle damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. Iwent up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in mylife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddlingharpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and tookoff my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took offmy coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very coldnow,  half  undressed  as  I  was,  and  remembering  what  the  landlord  said  about  theharpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado,but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled intobed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling,but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into alight doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when Iheard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room fromunder the door.Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I layperfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand,and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, andwithout looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor inone corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I beforespoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted forsome time while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, heturned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s justas I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here heis, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards thelight, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares onhis cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make ofthis; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a  whaleman  too—who,  falling  among  the  cannibals,  had  been  tattooed  by  them.  Iconcluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with asimilar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be
honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part ofit, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. Tobe sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hotsun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in theSouth Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer nevernoticed  me  at  all.  But,  after  some  difficulty  having  opened  his  bag,  he  commencedfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with thehair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the NewZealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now tookoff his hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. Therewas no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a small scalp-knot twistedup on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewedskull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of itquicker than ever I bolted a dinner.Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the secondfloor  back.  I  am  no  coward,  but  what  to  make  of  this  head-peddling  purple  rascalaltogether  passed  my  comprehension.  Ignorance  is  the  parent  of  fear,  and  beingcompletely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as muchafraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the deadof night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to addresshim, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest andarms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as hisface; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a ThirtyYears’ War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legswere marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of youngpalms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shippedaboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quakedto think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He mighttake a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something thatcompletely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen.Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on achair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed imagewith  a  hunch  on  its  back,  and  exactly  the  colour  of  a  three  days’  old  Congo  baby.Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was areal baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, andthat it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but awooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like atenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were verysooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel forhis Congo idol.
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at easemeantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double handful ofshavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying abit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavingsinto a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastierwithdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at lastsucceeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he madea polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sortof fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by stillstranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or elsesinging some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the mostunnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging adead woodcock.All  these  queer  proceedings  increased  my  uncomfortableness,  and  seeing  him  nowexhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bedwith me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to breakthe spell in which I had so long been bound.But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up histomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it tothe light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. Thenext moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between histeeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a suddengrunt of astonishment he began feeling me.Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall,and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get upand light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but illcomprehended my meaning.“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.” And sosaying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels!save me!”“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the cannibal, whilehis horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till Ithought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord cameinto the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t harm a hair ofyour head.”“Stop  your  grinning,”  shouted  I,  “and  why  didn’t  you  tell  me  that  that  infernalharpooneer was a cannibal?”“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads around town?—butturn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you
this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.“You  gettee  in,”  he  added,  motioning  to  me  with  his  tomahawk,  and  throwing  theclothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitableway. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean,comely looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I tomyself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as Ihave to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you callit; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don’t fancy havinga man smoking in bed with me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me toget into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”I turned in, and never slept better in my life.

The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde Originally from The Court and Soceity Review (1887-feb/mar)  I WHEN, Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American minister, bought Canterville Chase, every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis, when they came to discuss terms.    "We have not cared to live in the place ourselves," said Lord Canterville, "since my grand-aunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was frightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered,  by  two  skeleton  hands  being  placed  on  her  shoulders  as  she was  dressing  for dinner, and I feet bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been seen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none  very  little  sleep  at  night,  in  consequence  of  the  mysterious  noises  that  came  of  our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often got from the corridor and the library."    "My lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy; and with all our spry  young  fellows  painting  the  Old  World  red,  and  carrying  off  your  best  actresses  and prima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show."    "I fear that the ghost exists," said Lord Canterville, smiling, "though it may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family."    "Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy."    "You are certainly very natural in America," answered Lord Canterville, who did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, "and if you don't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember I warned you."    A  few  weeks  after  this,  the  purchase  was  completed,  and  at  the  close  of  the  season  the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase. Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan,  of  West  53rd  Street,  had  been  a  celebrated  New  York  belle,  was  now  a  very handsome middle-aged woman, with fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving their native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the impression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had never fallen into this error. She had
2a magnificent constitution, and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents in a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret,  was  a  fair-haired,  rather  good-looking  young  man,  who  had  qualified  himself  for American  diplomacy  by  leading  the  German  at  the  Newport  Casino  for  three  successive seasons,  and  even  in  London  was  well  known  as  an  excellent  dancer.  Gardenias  and  the peerage were his only  weaknesses. Otherwise  he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful amazon, and had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length and a half, just in front of Achilles statue, to the huge delight of the young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed to her on the spot, and was sent back  to  Eton  that  very  night  by  his  guardians,  in  floods  of  tears.  After  Virginia  came  the twins, who were usually called "The Stars and Stripes" as they were always getting swished. They  were  delightful  boys,  and  with  the  exception  of  the  worthy Minister  the  only  true republicans of the family.    As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway station, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and they started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pine woods. Now and then they heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or saw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant. Little squirrels peered at them from the beech trees as they went by, and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls,  with  their  white  tails  in  the  air.  As  they  entered  the  avenue  of  Canterville  Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the  atmosphere,  a  great  flight  of  rooks  passed  silently  over  their  heads,  and,  before  they reached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.    Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in black silk, with a white  cap  and  apron.  This  was  Mrs.  Umney,  the  housekeeper,  whom  Mrs. Otis,  at  Lady Canterville's earnest request, had consented to keep on in her former position. She made them each a low curtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner, "I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase." Following her, they passed through the fine Tudor hall into the library, a tong, low room, paneled in black oak, at the end of which was a large stained-glass window. Here they found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps, they sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.    Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs. Umney, "I am afraid something has been spilt there."    "Yes,  madam,"  replied  the  old  housekeeper  in  a  low  voice,  "blood  has been  spilt  on that spot."    "How horrid," cried Mrs. Otis. "I don't at all care for blood-stains in a sitting-room. It must be removed at once."    The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, "It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575. Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly
3under  very  mysterious  circumstances.  His  body  has  never  been  discovered,  but  his  guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed."    "That is all nonsense," cried Washington Otis; "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent  will clean it up in no time,"  and before the terrified  housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the blood-stain could be seen.    "I  knew  Pinkerton  would  do  it,"  he  exclaimed  triumphantly,  as  he  looked  round  at  his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the somber room, a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs. Umney fainted.    "What a monstrous climate!" said the American Minister calmly, as he lit a long cheroot. "I guess  the  old  country  is  so  overpopulated  that  they  have  not  enough  decent  weather  for everybody. I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England."    "My dear Hiram," cried Mrs. Otis, "what can we do with a woman who faints?"    "Charge it to her like breakages," answered the Minister; "she won't faint after that"; and in a few  moments  Mrs.  Umney  certainly  came  to.  There  was  no  doubt,  however,  that  she  was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.    "I have seen things with my own eyes, sir," she said, "that would make any Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here." Mr. Otis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of Providence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.  II THE  storm  raged  fiercely  all  that  night,  but  nothing  of  particular  note  occurred.  The  next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast, they found the terrible stain of blood once  again  on  the  floor.  "I  don't  think  it  can  be  the  fault  of  the  Paragon  Detergent,"  said Washington, "for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost." He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the library had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried upstairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with crime. That night all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata were removed for ever.
4  The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out for a drive. They did not return home till nine o' clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectation which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena. The subjects  discussed,  as  I  have  since  learned  from  Mr.  Otis,  were merely  such  as  form  the ordinary  conversation  of  cultured  Americans  of  the  better  class,  such  as  the  immense superiority  of  Miss  Fanny  Davenport  over  Sarah  Bernhardt  as an  actress;  the  difficulty  of obtaining  green  corn,  buckwheat  cakes,  and  hominy,  even  in  the  best  English  houses;  the importance of Boston in the development of the world-soul; the advantages of the baggage check system in railway traveling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the London drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was Sir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o' clock the family retired and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time after, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside his room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming nearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o' clock He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued, and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his slippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened the door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect. His eyes were as red as burning coals;  long  grey  hair  fell  over  his  shoulders  in  matted  coils;  his  garments,  which  were  of antique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves.    "My  dear  sir,"  said  Mr.  Otis,  "I  really  must  insist  on  your  oiling  those  chains,  and  have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious upon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more should you require it." With these words the United States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and, closing his door, retired to rest.    For  a  moment  the  Canterville  ghost  stood  quite  motionless  in  natural  indignation;  then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor, he fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great oak  staircase,  a  door  was  flung  open,  two  little  white-robed  figures  appeared,  and  a  large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently no time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth Dimension of Space as a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house became quite quiet.    On reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up against a moonbeam to recover  his  breath,  and  began  to  try  and  realize  his  position.  Never,  in  a  brilliant  and uninterrupted career of three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the Dowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass in her lace and  diamonds;  of  the  four  housemaids,  who  had  gone  off  into  hysterics  when he  merely grinned at them through the curtains of one of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr to nervous disorders; and of  old  Madame  de  Tremouillac,  who,  having  wakened  up  one  morning  early  and  seen  a skeleton seated in an armchair by the fire reading her diary had been confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become reconciled to the
5Church, and had broken off her connection with that notorious skeptic Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible night when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room,  with  the  knave  of  diamonds  half-way  down  his  throat,  and  confessed,  just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of £50,000 at Crockford's by means of  that  very  card,  and  swore  that  the  ghost  had  made  him  swallow  it.  All  his  great achievements came back to him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the window pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin, and who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of  the  King's  Walk  With  the  enthusiastic  egotism  of  the  true  artist  he  went  over  his  most celebrated  performances,  and  smiled  bitterly  to  himself  as  he  recalled  to  mind  his  last appearance as "Red Ruben, or the Strangled Babe," his debut as "Gaunt Gibeon, the Blood-sucker  of  Bexley  Moor,"  and  the  furor  he  had  excited  one  lonely  June  evening by  merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And after all this, some wretched  modern  Americans  were  to  come  and  offer  him  the  Rising  Sun  Lubricator,  and throw pillows at his head! It was quite unbearable. Besides, no ghosts in history had ever been treated  in  this  manner.  Accordingly,  he  determined  to  have  vengeance,  and  remained  till daylight in an attitude of deep thought.  III THE next morning when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed the ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a little annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. "I have no wish," he said, "to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him" -- a very just remark, at which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts  of  laughter.  "Upon  the  other  hand,"  he  continued,  "if  he  really  declines  to  use  the Rising  Sun  Lubricator,  we  shall  have  to  take  his  chains  from  him.  It  would  be  quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside the bedrooms."    For the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing that excited any attention being the continual renewal of the blood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very  strange,  as  the  door  was  always  locked  at  night  by  Mr.  Otis,  and  the  windows  kept closely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a good deal of comment. Some  mornings  it  was  a  dull  (almost  Indian)  red,  then  it  would  be  vermilion,  then  a  rich purple, and once when they came down for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free American Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright emerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much, and bets on the subject were freely  made  every  evening.  The  only  person  who  did  not  enter  into  the  joke  was  little Virginia, who, for some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the  blood-stain,  and  very  nearly  cried  the  morning  it  was  emerald-green.  The  second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall. Rushing downstairs, they found that a large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand, and had  fallen  on the stone floor, while, seated in a high-backed  chair, was the Canterville  ghost, rubbing his knees  with an expression of acute agony on his face. The twins, having brought their peashooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on him, With that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United States Minister covered
6him with his revolver, and called upon him, in accordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost started up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a mist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so leaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely useful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single night, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French governesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown.    "I am afraid you are far from well," she said, "and have brought you a bottle of Dr. Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a most excellent remedy." The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family doctor always attributed  the permanent idiocy  of  Lord  Canterville's  uncle,  the Hon.  Thomas  Horton.  The sound  of  approaching  footsteps,  however,  made  him  hesitate  in  his  fell  purpose,  so  he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep church-yard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.    On  reaching  his  room  he  entirely  broke  down,  and  became  a  prey  to  the  most  violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross materialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what really distressed him most was, that he had been unable to wear the suit of mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by the sight of a Spectre In Armour, if for no more sensible reason, at least out of respect for their national poet Longfellow, over whose graceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary hour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides, it was his own suit. He had worn it with success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen herself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely  overpowered  by  the  weight  of  the  huge  breastplate  and  steel  casque,  and  had fallen  heavily  on  the  stone  pavement,  barking  both  his  knees  severely,  and  bruising  the knuckles of his right hand.    For some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of his room at all, except to  keep  the  blood-stain  in  proper  repair.  However,  by  taking  great  care  of  himself  he recovered, and resolved to make a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his family. He selected Friday, the 17th of August, for his appearance, and spent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet frilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was just such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to make his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the foot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound of slow music. He bore Washington  a  special  grudge,  being  quite  aware  that  it  was  he  who was  in  the  habit  of removing  the  famous  Canterville  blood-stain,  by  means  of  Pinkerton's Paragon  Detergent. Having reduced the reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was then to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and his wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead, while he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of the charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made up his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and gentle. A few hollow groans
7from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more than sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the counterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite determined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of course, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling sensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each other, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse, till they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the winding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white bleached bones and one rolling eyeball, in the character of "Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's Skeleton," a role in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of "Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery."    At half past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was disturbed by wild shrieks  of  laughter  from  the  twins,  who,  with  the  lighthearted  gaiety  of  schoolboys,  were evidently amusing themselves before they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still, and, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the window panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family slept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm  he  could  hear  the  steady  snoring  of  the  Minister  for  the United  States.  He  stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with  an evil smile on his cruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like an evil shadow, the very  darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed. Once  he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless Washington's  room.  For a  moment  he paused  there,  the  wind blowing  his  long  grey  locks about his head, and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's shroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was come. He chuckled to himself and turned the corner; but no sooner had he done so, than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid his blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was standing a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a madman's dream!  Its  head  was  bald  and  burnished;  its  face  round,  and  fat,  and  white;  and  hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like to his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of shame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime, and, with its right hand, it bore aloft a fashion of gleaming steel.    Never having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened, and, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to his room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the corridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the privacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small pallet-bed and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however, the brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself and he determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly, just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling that, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of his  new  friend,  he  might  safely  grapple  with  the  twins.  On  reaching  the  spot,  however,  a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had evidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was
8leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a  sweeping-brush,  a  kitchen  cleaver,  and  a  hollow  turnip  lying  at  his  feet!  Unable  to understand this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there, in the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:  YE OTIS GHOSTE  YE ONLIE TRUE AND ORIGINALE SPOOK.  BEWARE OF YE IMITATIONES.ALL    OTHERS    ARE    COUNTERFEITE.The  whole  thing  flashed  across  him.  He  had  been  tricked,  foiled,  and  outwitted!  The  old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his toothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his head, swore, according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique  school,  that  when  Chanticleer  had  sounded  twice  his  merry  horn, deeds  of  blood would be wrought, and Murder walk abroad with silent feet.    Hardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of a distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh, and waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange reason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of  the  housemaids  made  him  give  up  his  fearful  vigil,  and  he  stalked  back  to  his  room, thinking of his vain hope and baffled purpose. There he consulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was exceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which his oath  had  been  used,  Chanticleer  had  always  crowed  a  second  time.  "Perdition  seize  the naughty fowl," he muttered, "I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an 'twere in death!" He then retired to a comfortable lead coffin, and stayed there till evening.  IV THE next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement of the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were completely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five days he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want it, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a low, material plane of existence, and quite incapable  of  appreciating  the  symbolic  value  of  sensuous  phenomena.  The  question  of phantasmic apparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a different matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third Wednesday in every month, and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is quite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was most conscientious in all
things connected with the supernatural. For the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight and three o' clock, taking every possible precaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots, trod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a little humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree, it served his purpose. Still, in spite  of  everything,  he  was  not  left  unmolested.  Strings  were  continually  being  stretched across the corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while dressed for the  part  of  "Black  Isaac,  or  the  Huntsman  of  Hogley  Woods,"  he  met  with  a  severe  fall, through treading on a butter-slide, which the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry  Chamber  to  the  top  of  the  oak  staircase.  This  last  insult  so  enraged  him,  that  he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social position, and determined to visit  the  insolent  young  Estonians  the  next  night  in  his  celebrated character  of  "Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl."    He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened  pretty  Lady  Barbara  Modish  by  means  of  it,  that  she  suddenly  broke  off  her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castleton, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into  a  family  that  allowed  such  a  horrible  phantom  to  walk  up  and  down  the  terrace  at twilight.  Poor  Jack  was  afterwards  shot  in  a  duel  by  Lord  Canterville  on  Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken heart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out,  so,  in  every  way,  it had been  a  great  success.  It  was,  however,  an  extremely  difficult "make-up," if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more scientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three hours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was very pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only find one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite satisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins, which I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make an effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his nervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he could go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences might have been very serious.    He  now  gave  up  all  hope  of  ever  frightening  this  rude  American  family,  and  contented himself as a rule, with creeping about the passages in list slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of draughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the  twins.  The  final  blow  he  received  occurred  on  the  19th  of  September.  He  had  gone downstairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested,  and  was  amusing  himself  by  making  satirical  remarks on  the  large  Saroni photographs of the United States Minister and his wife, which had now taken the place of the Canterville  family  pictures.  He  was  simply  but  neatly  clad  in  a  long  shroud,  spotted  with
10churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In fact, he was dressed for the character of "Jonas the Graveless, or the Corpse-Snatcher  of  Chertsey  Barn,"  one  of  his  most  remarkable  impersonations,  and  one which the Cantervilles had every reason to remember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As he was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any traces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him  from  a  dark  corner  two  figures,  who  waved  their  arms  wildly above  their  heads,  and shrieked out "BOO!" in his ear.    Seized  with  a panic,  which,  under  the  circumstances,  was  only  natural,  he  rushed  for  the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him there with the big garden-syringe; and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make his way home  through  the  flues  and  chimneys,  arriving  at  his  own  room  in  a  terrible  state  of  dirt, disorder, and despair.    After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins lay in wait for him on  several  occasions,  and  strewed  the  passages  with  nutshells  every  night  to  the  great annoyance of their parents and the servants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings were so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed his great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had been engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful clambake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse, euchre, poker, and other American national games; and Virginia rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire, who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville Chase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best congratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.    The Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the house, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters  rest, particularly  as he heard that among the guests was the young Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had  once  bet  a  hundred  guineas  with  Colonel  Carbury  that  he  would  play  dice  with  the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the floor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state, that though he lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but "Double Sixes." The story was well known at the time, though, of course, out of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt was made to hush it up; and a full account of all the circumstances connected with it will be found in the third volume of  Lord  Tattle's Recollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends.  The  ghost,  then,  was naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the Stiltons, with whom indeed,  he  was  distantly  connected,  his  own  first  cousin  having been  married en secondes noces to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia's little lover in  his  celebrated  impersonation  of  "The  Vampire  Monk,  or,  the  Bloodless  Benedictine,"  a performance so horrible that when old Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in the year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which culminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after disinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and leaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,
11however, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the little Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.  V A FEW  days  after  this,  Virginia  and  her  curly-haired  cavalier  went  out  riding  on  Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a hedge, that, on her return home, she made up her mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past the Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be opened, she fancied she saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who sometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend her habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of the yellow trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so much out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea had been to  run  away  and  lock  herself  in  her  room,  was  filled  with pity,  and  determined  to  try  and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him.    "I am so sorry for you," she said, "but my brothers are going back to Eton tomorrow, and then, if you behave yourself no one will annoy you."    "It is absurd asking me to behave myself" he answered, looking round in astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him, "quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan  through  keyholes,  and  walk  about  at  night,  if  that  is  what  you  mean.  It  is  my  only reason for existing."    "It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very wicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had killed your wife."    "Well, I quite admit it," said the Ghost petulantly, "but it was a purely family matter, and concerned no one else."    "It is very wrong to kill any one," said Virginia, who at times had a sweet Puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.    "Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very plain, never had my ruffs properly  starched,  and  knew  nothing  about  cookery.  Why,  there  was  a  buck  I  had  shot  in Hogley  Woods,  a  magnificent  pricket,  and  do  you  know  how  she  had  it  sent  up  to  table? However,  it  is  no  matter  now,  for  it  is  all  over,  and  I  don't  think  it  was  very  nice  of  her brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her."    "Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost, I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I have a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?"    "No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you, all the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude, vulgar, dishonest family."
12  "Stop!" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, "it is you who are rude, and horrid, and vulgar; and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain in the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and I couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the chrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese white, and could only do moonlight scenes, which  are  always  depressing  to  look  at,  and  not  at  all  easy  to  paint.  I  never  told  on  you, though I was very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who ever heard of emerald-green blood?"    "Well, really," said the Ghost, rather meekly, "what was I to do? It is a very difficult thing to get  real  blood  nowadays,  and,  as  your  brother  began  it  all  with  his  Paragon  Detergent,  I certainly saw no reason why I should not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of taste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest in England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this kind."    "You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind. My  father will be only too happy to  give  you a free passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind, there will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are all Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I know lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family Ghost."    "I don't think I should like America."    "I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities," said Virginia satirically.    "No ruins! no curiosities!" answered the Ghost; "you have your navy and your manners."    "Good evening; I will go and ask Papa to get the twins an extra week's holiday."    "Please don't go, Miss Virginia," he cried; "I am so lonely and so unhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I cannot."    "That's  quite  absurd!  You  have  merely  to  go  to  bed  and  blow  out  the  candle.  It  is  very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at church, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even babies know how to do that, and they are not very clever."    "I have not slept for three hundred years," he said sadly, and Virginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; "for three hundred years I have not slept, and I am so tired."    Virginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like rose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked up into his old withered face.    "Poor, poor Ghost," she murmured; "have you no place where you can sleep?"    "Far away beyond the pine-woods," he answered, in a low dreamy voice, "there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale sings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal moon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers."
13  Virginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.    "You mean the Garden of Death," she whispered.    "Yes, Death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of Death's house, for Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than Death is."    Virginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments there was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.    Then the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind.    "Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?"    "Oh, often," cried the little girl, looking up; "I know it quite well. It is painted in curious black letters, and it is difficult to read. There are only six lines:  WHEN    A    GOLDEN    GIRL    CAN    WINPRAYER   FROM   OUT   THE   LIPS   OF   SIN,WHEN   THE   BARREN   ALMOND   BEARS,AND A LITTLE CHILD GIVES AWAY ITS TEARS,THEN  SHALL  ALL  THE  HOUSE  BE  STILLAND PEACE COME TO CANTERVILLE.  But I don't know what they mean.    "They mean," he said  sadly,  "that  you must weep for me  for my sins, because  I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no faith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the Angel of Death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in darkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not harm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell cannot prevail."    Virginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very pale, and with a strange light in her eyes. "I am not afraid," she said firmly, "and I will ask the Angel to have mercy on you."    He rose  from his seat  with a faint cry of joy,  and taking her hand bent over it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold as ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back "Go back! Little Virginia," they cried, "go back!" but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails, and goggle eyes, blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured, "Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again," but the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When they reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress. "Quick, quick," cried the Ghost, or it will be too late,"
14and, in a moment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.  VI ABOUT ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not come down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a little time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia anywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every evening to  get  flowers  for  the  dinner  table,  Mrs.  Otis  was  not  at  all alarmed  at  first, but  when  six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not appear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for her, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At half-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace of their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of excitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly remembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gypsies permission to camp in the park He accordingly at once set off for Blackfell Hollow, where he knew they were,  accompanied  by  his  eldest  son  and  two  of  the  farm-servants.  The  little  Duke  of Cheshire, who was perfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too, but Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a scuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gypsies had gone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire was still burning, and some plates were  lying on the  grass. Having  sent  off  Washington  and  the  two  men  to  scour  the  district,  he  ran  home,  and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county, telling them to look out for a little  girl  who  had  been  kidnapped  by  tramps  or  gypsies.  He  then  ordered  his  horse  to  be brought round, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off down the Ascot Road with a groom. He had hardly, however, gone a couple of miles when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed and no hat. "I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis," gasped out the boy, "but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost. Please, don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year, there would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back, will you? I can't go! I won't go!"    The Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace, and was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, "Well, Cecil, if you won't go back I suppose you must come with me, but I must get you a hat at Ascot."    "Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!" cried the little Duke, laughing, and they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of the station-master if any one answering the description  of  Virginia  had been  seen  on  the platform, but  could  get  no  news  of  her.  The station-master,  however,  wired  up  and  down  the  line,  and  assured  him  that  a  strict  watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a hat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his shutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away, which he was told was a well-known haunt of the gypsies, as there was a large common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but could get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase about eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found Washington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with lanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not  the  slightest  trace  of  Virginia  had  been  discovered.  The  gypsies  had  been  caught  on
15Broxley meadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off in a hurry for fear they  might  be  late.  Indeed,  they  had  been  quite  distressed  at  hearing  of  Virginia's disappearance, as they were very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his park, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search. The carp-pond had been  dragged,  and  the  whole  Chase  thoroughly  gone  over,  hut  without  any  result. It  was evident  that,  for  that  night  at  any  rate,  Virginia  was  lost  to  them;  and  it  was  in  a  state  of deepest depression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom following behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they found a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library was poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and having her forehead bathed with eau-de-Cologne by the old housekeeper. Mr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up supper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one spoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very fond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the entreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that nothing more could be done  that  night,  and  that  he  would  telegraph  in  the  morning  to  Scotland  Yard  for  some detectives to be sent down immediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight began to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out on the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs. Otis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with violent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.    "Good heavens! child, where have you been?" said Mr. Otis, rather angrily, thinking that she had  been  playing  some  foolish  trick  on  them.  "Cecil  and  I  have  been  riding  all  over  the country looking for you, and your mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these practical jokes any more.    "Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!" shrieked the twins, as they capered about. "My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side again," murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and smoothed the tangled gold of her hair.    "Papa," said Virginia quietly, "I have been with the Ghost. He is dead, and you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was really sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he died." The whole family gazed at her in mute astonishment, but she was quite grave and serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a lighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they came to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia touched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they  found  themselves  in  a  little  low  room,  with  a  vaulted  ceiling,  and  one  tiny  grated window. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its reach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was covered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but a pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the party looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them.
16  "Hallo!" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out of the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was situated. "Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see the flowers quite plainly in the moonlight."    "God has forgiven him," said Virginia gravely, as she rose to her feet, and a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.    "What an angel  you are!" cried the  young Duke, and  he put his  arm  round her neck and kissed her.  VII FOUR  days  after  these  curious  incidents  a  funeral  started  from  Canterville  Chase  at  about eleven o' clock at night. The hearse was drawn by eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was  wonderfully  impressive.  Lord  Canterville  was  the  chief  mourner,  having  come  up specially  from  Wales  to  attend  the  funeral,  and  sat  in  the  first  carriage  along  with  little Virginia. Then came the United States Minister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service was read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier. When the ceremony was over the servants according to an old custom observed in the Canterville family,  extinguished  their  torches,  and,  as  the  coffin  was  being  lowered  into  the  grave, Virginia  stepped  forward  and  laid  on  it  a  large  cross  made  of  white  and  pink  almond-blossoms. As she did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the Garden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home.    The next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had an interview with him  on  the  subject  of  the  jewels  the  ghost  had  given  to  Virginia.  They  were  perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby necklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen of sixteenth-century  work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.    "My Lord," he said, "I know that in this country mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg you, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them simply as a portion of  your property which has been restored to  you under certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a child, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I may  say,  is  no  mean  authority  upon  Art  --  having  had  the  privilege  of  spending  several winters in Boston when she was a girl -- that these gems are of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you will recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the
17possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain gauds and toys, however suitable  or  necessary  to  the  dignity  of  the  British  aristocracy,  would  be  completely  out  of place  among  those  who  have  been  brought  up  on  the  severe,  and  I  believe  immortal, principles of  republican  simplicity. Perhaps  I should mention that Virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and consequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal surprised to find  a  child  of  mine  expressing  sympathy  with  mediaevalism  in any  form,  and  can  only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a trip to Athens."    Lord  Canterville  listened  very  gravely  to  the  worthy  Minister's  speech,  pulling  his  grey mustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile, and when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and said, "My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are much indebted to her for her marvelous courage and pluck. The jewels are clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough to take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being heirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and when Miss Virginia grows up I daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to wear. Besides,  you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase."    Mr.  Otis  was  a  good  deal  distressed  at  Lord  Canterville's  refusal,  and  begged  him  to reconsider  his  decision,  but  the  good  natured  peer  was  quite  firm,  and  finally  induced  the Minister to allow his daughter to retain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of 1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first drawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the universal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and they loved  each  other  so  much,  that  every  one  was  delighted  at  the  match,  except  the  old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch the Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less than three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to say, Mr. Otis himself Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke personally, but,  theoretically,  he  objected  to  titles,  and,  to  use  his  own  words,  "was  not  without apprehension  lest,  amid  the  enervating  influences  of  a pleasure-loving  aristocracy,  the  true principles  of  republican  simplicity  should  be  forgotten."  His  objections,  however,  were completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the aisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his arm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of England.    The Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to Canterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over in the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods.  There  had  been  a  great  deal  of  difficulty  at  first about  the  inscription  on  Sir Simon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the library window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses, which she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for
18some time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There the Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly he threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her, "Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband."    "Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you."    "Yes, you have," he answered, smiling, "you have never told me what happened to you when you were locked up with the ghost."    "I have never told any one, Cecil," said Virginia gravely.    "I know that, but you might tell me."    "Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe him a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see what Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than both."    The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.    "You can have your secret as long as I have your heart," he murmured.    "You have always had that, Cecil."    "And you will tell our children some day, won't you?"    Virginia blushed.  (End.)

Come, madam, let’s away.[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]BENVOLIO  Good morrow, cousin.ROMEO  Is the day so young?BENVOLIO  But new struck nine.ROMEO  Ay me! sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fast?BENVOLIO  It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?ROMEO  Not having that, which, having, makes them short.BENVOLIO  In love?
Romeo and Juliet:  ACT IVolume III   Book IX8ROMEO  Out—BENVOLIO  Of love?ROMEO  Out of her favour, where I am in love.BENVOLIO  Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!ROMEO  Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!O any thing, of nothing first create!O heavy lightness! serious vanity!Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,sick health!Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!This love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laugh?BENVOLIO  No, coz, I rather weep.ROMEO  Good heart, at what?BENVOLIO  At thy good heart’s oppression.ROMEO  Why, such is love’s transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prestWith more of thine: this love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;Being vex’d a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:What is it else? a madness most discreet,A choking gall and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz.BENVOLIO  Soft! I will go along;An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.ROMEO  Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.BENVOLIO  Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.ROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?BENVOLIO  Groan! why, no;But sadly tell me who.ROMEO  Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.BENVOLIO  I aim’d so near, when I supposed you loved.ROMEO  A right good mark-man! And she’s fair I love.BENVOLIO  A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.ROMEO  Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hitWith Cupid’s arrow; she hath Dian’s wit;And, in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,From love’s weak childish bow she lives unharm’d.She will not stay the siege of loving terms,Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,That when she dies with beauty dies her store.BENVOLIO  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?ROMEO  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,For beauty starved with her severityCuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair:She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead that live to tell it now.BENVOLIO  Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.ROMEO  O, teach me how I should forget to think.BENVOLIO  By giving liberty unto thine eyes;Examine other beauties.ROMEO  ’Tis the wayTo call hers exquisite, in question more:These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ browsBeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:Show me a mistress that is passing fair,What doth her beauty serve, but as a noteWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.BENVOLIO  I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.[Exeunt]SCENE IIA street.[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]CAPULET  But Montague is bound as well as I,In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,For men so old as we to keep the peace.

I pray, sir, can you read?ROMEO  Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.SERVANT  Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I pray, can you read any thing you see?ROMEO  Ay, if I know the letters and the language.SERVANT  Ye say honestly: rest you merry!ROMEO  Stay, fellow; I can read.[Reads]“Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the ladywidow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovelynieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mineuncle Capulet, his wife—and daughters; my fair nieceRosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousinTybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.” A fairassembly: whither should they come?SERVANT  Up.ROMEO  Whither?SERVANT  To supper; to our house.ROMEO  Whose house?SERVANT  My master’s.ROMEO  Indeed, I should have ask’d you that before.SERVANT  Now I’ll tell you without asking: my master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house

What, Juliet![Enter JULIET]JULIET  How now! who calls?NURSE  Your mother.JULIET  Madam, I am here.What is your will?LADY CAPULET  This is the matter:—Nurse, give leave awhile,We must talk in secret:—nurse, come back again;I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age.NURSE  Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.LADY CAPULET  She’s not fourteen.NURSE  I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,—And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four—She is not fourteen. How long is it nowTo Lammas-tide?LADY CAPULET  A fortnight and odd days.NURSE  Even or odd, of all days in the year,Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!—Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;She was too good for me: but, as I said,On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;That shall she, marry; I remember it well.’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it,—Of all the days of the year, upon that day:For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;My lord and you were then at Mantua:—Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!Shake quoth the dove-house: ’twas no need, I trow,To bid me trudge:And since that time it is eleven years;For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,She could have run and waddled all about;For even the day before, she broke her brow:And then my husband—God be with his soul!A’was a merry man—took up the child:“Yea,”quoth he, “dost thou fall upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;Wilt thou not, Jule?” and, by my holidame,The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”To see, now, how a jest shall come about!I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,I never should forget it: “Wilt thou not, Jule?” quoth he;And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”LADY CAPULET  Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.NURSE  Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,To think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”And yet, I warrant, it had upon its browA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:“Yea,”quoth my husband, “fall’st upon thy face?
Romeo and Juliet:  ACT IVolume III   Book IX11Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Wilt thou not, Jule?” it stinted and said “Ay.”JULIET  And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.NURSE  Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nursed:An I might live to see thee married once,I have my wish.LADY CAPULET  Marry, that “marry” is the very themeI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,How stands your disposition to be married?JULIET  It is an honour that I dream not of.NURSE  An honour! were not I thine only nurse,I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.LADY CAPULET  Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,Are made already mothers: by my count,I was your mother much upon these yearsThat you are now a maid.

Romeo and Juliet:  ACT IVolume III   Book IX12MERCUTIO  And, to sink in it, should you burden love;Too great oppression for a tender thing.ROMEO  Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.MERCUTIO  If love be rough with you, be rough with love;Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.Give me a case to put my visage in:A visor for a visor! what care IWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.BENVOLIO  Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,But every man betake him to his legs.ROMEO  A torch for me: let wantons light of heartTickle the senseless rushes with their heels,For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase;I’ll be a candle-holder, and look on.The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.MERCUTIO  Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mireOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick’stUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!ROMEO  Nay, that’s not so.MERCUTIO  I mean, sir, in delayWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.Take our good meaning, for our judgement sitsFive times in that ere once in our five wits.ROMEO  And we mean well in going to this mask;But ’tis no wit to go.MERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?ROMEO  I dream’d a dream to-night.MERCUTIO  And so did I.ROMEO  Well, what was yours?MERCUTIO  That dreamers often lie.ROMEO  In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.MERCUTIO  O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate-stoneOn the fore-finger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesAthwart men’s noses as they lie asleep;Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders’ legs,The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,The traces of the smallest spider’s web,The collars of the moonshine’s watery beams,Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,Not so big as a round little wormPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid;Her chariot is an empty hazel-nutMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by nightThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on court’sies straight,O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees,O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tailTickling a parson’s nose as a’ lies asleep,Then dreams, he of another benefice:Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,And being thus frighted swears a prayer or twoAnd sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night,And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she—ROMEO  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!Thou talk’st of nothing.MERCUTIO  True, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,Which is as thin of substance as the airAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooesEven now the frozen bosom of the north,And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.BENVOLIO  This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;Supper is done, and we shall come too late.ROMEO  I fear, too early: for my mind misgivesSome consequence yet hanging in the starsShall bitterly begin his fearful date

waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most ofthem had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from themlike the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them.The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarianthan the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers,white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide,all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trouserstucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches.They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stagethey would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands.They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in naturalself-assertion.It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is avery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the BorgoPass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy existence, andit certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires tookplace, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the verybeginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeksand  lost  13,000  people,  the  casualties  of  war  proper  being  assisted  byfamine and disease.Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, whichI found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of courseI  wanted  to  see  all  I  could  of  the  ways  of  the  country.  I  was  evidentlyexpected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderlywoman in the usual peasant dress—white undergarment with long doubleapron,  front,  and  back,  of  coloured  stuff  fitting  almost  too  tight  formodesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?”“Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to anelderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. Hewent, but immediately returned with a letter:—“My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expectingyou. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will start forBukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage willawait you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from Londonhas been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautifulland.
“Your friend,“DRACULA.”4 May.—I  found  that  my  landlord  had  got  a  letter  from  the  Count,directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on makinginquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that hecould not understand my German. This could not be true, because up tothen he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questionsexactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me,looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that themoney had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I askedhim if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle,both  he  and  his  wife  crossed  themselves,  and,  saying  that  they  knewnothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time ofstarting  that  I  had  no  time  to  ask  any  one  else,  for  it  was  all  verymysterious and not by any means comforting.Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said ina very hysterical way:“Must  you  go?  Oh!  young  Herr,  must  you  go?”  She  was  in  such  anexcited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German sheknew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not knowat all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I toldher that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,she asked again:“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.She shook her head as she said again:“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” Onmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, whenthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have fullsway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?” Shewas in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect.Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least towait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did notfeel  comfortable.  However,  there  was  business  to  be  done,  and  I  couldallow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said,as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and
that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix fromher neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an EnglishChurchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measureidolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaningso well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in myface, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’ssake,” and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diarywhilst  I  am  waiting  for  the  coach,  which  is,  of  course,  late;  and  thecrucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or themany ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know,but  I  am  not  feeling  nearly  as  easy  in  my  mind  as  usual.  If  this  bookshould ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comesthe coach!5 May. The Castle.—The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun ishigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees orhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. Iam not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I writetill sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest whoreads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me putdown my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called “robber steak”—bitsof bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticksand roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat’s meat! Thewine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue,which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this,and nothing else.When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw himtalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for everynow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sittingon the bench outside the door—which they call by a name meaning “word-bearer”—came  and  listened,  and  then  looked  at  me,  most  of  thempityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for therewere  many  nationalities  in  the  crowd;  so  I  quietly  got  my  polyglotdictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were notcheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan, “pokol”—hell,“stregoica”—witch,  “vrolok”  and  “vlkoslak”—both  of  which  mean  thesame thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
either  were-wolf  or  vampire.  (Mem.,  I  must  ask  the  Count  about  thesesuperstitions)When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this timeswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointedtwo fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger totell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning thatI was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evileye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown placeto meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and sosorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall neverforget  the  last  glimpse  which  I  had  of  the  inn-yard  and  its  crowd  ofpicturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the widearchway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange treesin green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whosewide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat—“gotza” theycall  them—cracked  his  big  whip  over  his  four  small  horses,  which  ranabreast, and we set off on our journey.I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of thescene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or ratherlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not havebeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping landfull of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned withclumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. Therewas everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple, plum, pear,cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the treesspangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills ofwhat they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road, losing itself as it sweptround  the  grassy  curve,  or  was  shut  out  by  the  straggling  ends  of  pinewoods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverishhaste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver wasevidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told thatthis road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put inorder after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the generalrun of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not tobe kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest
the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopesof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right andleft of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them andbringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue andpurple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rockmingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, tillthese were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rosegrandly.  Here  and  there  seemed  mighty  rifts  in  the  mountains,  throughwhich, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam offalling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept roundthe  base  of  a  hill  and  opened  up  the  lofty,  snow-covered  peak  of  amountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be rightbefore us:—“Look! Isten szek!”—“God’s seat!”—and he crossed himself reverently.As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lowerbehind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This wasemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset,and  seemed  to  glow  out  with  a  delicate  cool  pink.  Here  and  there  wepassed  Cszeks  and  Slovaks,  all  in  picturesque  attire,  but  I  noticed  thatgoitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and aswe swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was apeasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turnround as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion tohave neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many thingsnew to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there verybeautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silverthrough the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon—the  ordinary  peasant’s  cart—with  its  long,  snake-like  vertebra,calculated  to  suit  the  inequalities  of  the  road.  On  this  were  sure  to  beseated  quite  a  group  of  home-coming  peasants,  the  Cszeks  with  theirwhite, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carryinglance-fashion  their  long  staves,  with  axe  at  end.  As  the  evening  fell  itbegan to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into onedark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in thevalleys  which  ran  deep  between  the  spurs  of  the  hills,  as  we  ascended
through  the  Pass,  the  dark  firs  stood  out  here  and  there  against  thebackground of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through thepine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, greatmasses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced apeculiarly  weird  and  solemn  effect,  which  carried  on  the  thoughts  andgrim  fancies  engendered  earlier  in  the  evening,  when  the  falling  sunsetthrew  into  strange  relief  the  ghost-like  clouds  which  amongst  theCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes thehills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could only goslowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but thedriver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not walk here; thedogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he evidently meant forgrim pleasantry—for he looked round to catch the approving smile of therest—“and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.”The only stop he would make was a moment’s pause to light his lamps.When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst thepassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as thoughurging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with hislong whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to furtherexertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of greylight ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitementof the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leathersprings, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on.The  road  grew  more  level,  and  we  appeared  to  fly  along.  Then  themountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown downupon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of thepassengers  offered  me  gifts,  which  they  pressed  upon  me  with  anearnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd andvaried kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word,and  a  blessing,  and  that  strange  mixture  of  fear-meaning  movementswhich I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz—the sign of the cross and theguard  against  the  evil  eye.  Then,  as  we  flew  along,  the  driver  leanedforward,  and  on  each  side  the  passengers,  craning  over  the  edge  of  thecoach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something veryexciting  was  either  happening  or  expected,  but  though  I  asked  eachpassenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state ofexcitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the
Pass  opening  out  on  the  eastern  side.  There  were  dark,  rolling  cloudsoverhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemedas  though  the  mountain  range  had  separated  two  atmospheres,  and  thatnow we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out forthe  conveyance  which  was  to  take  me  to  the  Count.  Each  moment  Iexpected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark.The  only  light  was  the  flickering  rays  of  our  own  lamps,  in  which  thesteam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could seenow the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of avehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemedto mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had bestdo, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others somethingwhich I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; Ithought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said inGerman worse than my own:—“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He willnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; betterthe next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snortand plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst achorus  of  screams  from  the  peasants  and  a  universal  crossing  ofthemselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us,and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, asthe  rays  fell  on  them,  that  the  horses  were  coal-black  and  splendidanimals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and agreat black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only seethe gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight,as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:—“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:—“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. Youcannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.”As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth,with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of mycompanions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:—“Denn die Todten reiten schnell”—(“For the dead travel fast.”)
The  strange  driver  evidently  heard  the  words,  for  he  looked  up  with  agleaming  smile.  The  passenger  turned  his  face  away,  at  the  same  timeputting  out  his  two  fingers  and  crossing  himself.  “Give  me  the  Herr’sluggage,”  said  the  driver;  and  with  exceeding  alacrity  my  bags  werehanded out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of thecoach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with ahand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have beenprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and weswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam fromthe horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against itthe figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the drivercracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their wayto Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and alonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders,and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:—“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me takeall  care  of  you.  There  is  a  flask  of  slivovitz  (the  plum  brandy  of  thecountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take any,but  it  was  a  comfort  to  know  it  was  there  all  the  same.  I  felt  a  littlestrangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternativeI should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey.The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a completeturn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we weresimply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note ofsome salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to haveasked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for Ithought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in casethere had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curiousto know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked atmy watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort ofshock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increasedby my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up byanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind whichnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemedto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it
through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strainand rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down,but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright.Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us begana louder and a sharper howling—that of wolves—which affected both thehorses and myself in the same way—for I was minded to jump from thecalèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that thedriver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a fewminutes,  however,  my  own  ears  got  accustomed  to  the  sound,  and  thehorses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to standbefore  them.  He  petted  and  soothed  them,  and  whispered  something  intheir ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinaryeffect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, thoughthey still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins,started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass,he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right overthe roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowningrocks  guarded  us  boldly  on  either  side.  Though  we  were  in  shelter,  wecould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks,and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grewcolder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soonwe and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen windstill carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we wenton our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as thoughthey were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid,and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the leastdisturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not seeanything through the darkness.Suddenly,  away  on  our  left,  I  saw  a  faint  flickering  blue  flame.  Thedriver  saw  it  at  the  same  moment;  he  at  once  checked  the  horses,  and,jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know whatto  do,  the  less  as  the  howling  of  the  wolves  grew  closer;  but  while  Iwondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took hisseat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep andkept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, andnow  looking  back,  it  is  like  a  sort  of  awful  nightmare.  Once  the  flame

For two hours the strange  business  in  which  we  had  been  involved  appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of  the  modern  Belgian  masters.  He  would  talk  of  nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.‘Sir  Henry  Baskerville  is  upstairs  expecting  you,’  said the  clerk.  ‘He  asked  me  to  show  you  up  at  once  when  you came.’‘Have you any objection to my looking at your register?’ said Holmes.‘Not in the least.’The  book  showed  that  two  names  had  been  added  after that of Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and fami-ly, of Newcastle; the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.‘Surely  that  must  be  the  same  Johnson  whom  I  used  to know,’ said Holmes to the porter. ‘A lawyer, is he not, gray-
The Hound of the Baskervilles headed, and walks with a limp?’‘No, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman, not older than yourself.’‘Surely you are mistaken about his trade?’‘No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well known to us.’‘Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remem-ber the name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds another.’‘She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.’‘Thank  you;  I  am  afraid  I  cannot  claim  her  acquain-tance. We have established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,’ he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. ‘We know now that the people who are so interested  in  our  friend  have  not  settled  down  in  his  own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very anxious  to  watch  him,  they  are  equally  anxious  that  he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.’‘What does it suggest?’‘It suggests—halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?’As  we  came  round  the  top  of  the  stairs  we  had  run  up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more West-ern dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.

By thunder, if that chap can’t find my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.’‘Still looking for your boot?’‘Yes, sir, and mean to find it.’‘But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?’‘So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.’‘What! you don’t mean to say——?’‘That’s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in  the  world—the  new  brown,  the  old  black,  and  the  pat-ent leathers, which I am wearing. Last night they took one of  my  brown  ones,  and  to-day  they  have  sneaked  one  of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and don’t stand staring!’An  agitated  German  waiter  had  appeared  upon  the scene.‘No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word of it.’‘Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.’‘It shall be found, sir—I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found.’‘Mind it is, for it’s the last thing of mine that I’ll lose in this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle——‘
The Hound of the Baskervilles ‘I think it’s well worth troubling about.’‘Why, you look very serious over it.’‘How do you explain it?’‘I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very mad-dest, queerest thing that ever happened to me.’‘The queerest perhaps——‘ said Holmes, thoughtfully.‘What do you make of it yourself?’‘Well,  I  don’t  profess  to  understand  it  yet.  This  case  of yours  is  very  complex,  Sir  Henry.  When  taken  in  conjunc-tion  with  your  uncle’s  death  I  am  not  sure  that  of  all  the five hundred cases of capital importance which I have han-dled  there  is  one  which  cuts  so  deep.  But  we  hold  several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may waste time in follow-ing the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right.’We  had  a  pleasant  luncheon  in  which  little  was  said  of the  business  which  had  brought  us  together.  It  was  in  the private  sitting-room  to  which  we  afterwards  repaired  that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions.‘To go to Baskerville Hall.’‘And when?’‘At the end of the week.’‘On the whole,’ said Holmes, ‘I think that your decision is a wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the millions of this great city it is dif-ficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might do you a mis-chief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not

By whom?’‘That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full beard?’‘No—or,  let  me  see—why,  yes.  Barrymore,  Sir  Charles’s butler, is a man with a full, black beard.’‘Ha! Where is Barrymore?’‘He is in charge of the Hall.’‘We  had  best  ascertain  if  he  is  really  there,  or  if  by  any possibility he might be in London.’‘How can you do that?’‘Give  me  a  telegraph  form.  ‘Is  all  ready  for  Sir  Henry?’ That  will  do.  Address  to  Mr.  Barrymore,  Baskerville  Hall. What  is  the  nearest  telegraph-office?  Grimpen.  Very  good, we  will  send  a  second  wire  to  the  postmaster,  Grimpen: ‘Telegram  to  Mr.  Barrymore  to  be  delivered  into  his  own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland  Hotel.’  That  should  let  us  know  before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.’‘That’s  so,’  said  Baskerville.  ‘By  the  way,  Dr.  Mortimer, who is this Barrymore, anyhow?’‘He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked  after  the  Hall  for  four  generations  now.  So  far  as  I know, he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county.’
The Hound of the Baskervilles ‘At the same time,’ said Baskerville, ‘it’s clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these peo-ple have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.’‘That is true.’‘Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?’ asked Holmes.‘He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.’‘Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?’‘Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provi-sions of his will.’‘That is very interesting.’‘I  hope,’  said  Dr.  Mortimer,  ‘that  you  do  not  look  with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.’‘Indeed! And anyone else?’‘There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a  large  number  of  public  charities.  The  residue  all  went  to Sir Henry.’‘And how much was the residue?’‘Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.’Holmes  raised  his  eyebrows  in  surprise.  ‘I  had  no  idea that so gigantic a sum was involved,’ said he.‘Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his  securities.  The  total  value  of  the  estate  was  close  on  to a million.’‘Dear  me!  It  is  a  stake  for  which  a  man  might  well  play a  desperate  game.  And  one  more  question,  Dr.  Mortimer. Supposing  that  anything  happened  to  our  young  friend
 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhere—you  will  forgive  the  unpleasant  hypothesis!—who would inherit the estate?’‘Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly cler-gyman in Westmoreland.’‘Thank  you.  These  details  are  all  of  great  interest.  Have you met Mr. James Desmond?’‘Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of  venerable  appearance  and  of  saintly  life.  I  remember that  he  refused  to  accept  any  settlement  from  Sir  Charles, though he pressed it upon him.’‘And  this  man  of  simple  tastes  would  be  the  heir  to  Sir Charles’s thousands.’‘He  would  be  the  heir  to  the  estate  because  that  is  en-tailed. He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.’‘And have you made your will, Sir Henry?’‘No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That  was  my  poor  uncle’s  idea.  How  is  the  owner  going  to restore  the  glories  of  the  Baskervilles  if  he  has  not  money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must go together.’‘Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to Devonshire with-out  delay.  There  is  only  one  provision  which  I  must  make.
The Hound of the Baskervilles 0You certainly must not go alone.’‘Dr. Mortimer returns with me.’‘But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house  is  miles  away  from  yours.  With  all  the  good  will  in the world he may be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man, who will be al-ways by your side.’‘Is  it  possible  that  you  could  come  yourself,  Mr.  Holm-es?’‘If  matters  came  to  a  crisis  I  should  endeavour  to  be present  in  person;  but  you  can  understand  that,  with  my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which  reach  me  from  many  quarters,  it  is  impossible  for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.’‘Whom would you recommend, then?’Holmes laid his hand upon my arm.‘If  my  friend  would  undertake  it  there  is  no  man  who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.’The proposition took me completely by surprise, but be-fore I had time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.‘Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,’ said he. ‘You see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall

I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?’‘Would that suit Dr. Watson?’‘Perfectly.’‘Then  on  Saturday,  unless  you  hear  to  the  contrary,  we shall meet at the 10:30 train from Paddington.’We  had  risen  to  depart  when  Baskerville  gave  a  cry,  of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet.‘My missing boot!’ he cried.‘May  all  our  difficulties  vanish  as  easily!’  said  Sherlock Holmes.‘But it is a very singular thing,’ Dr. Mortimer remarked. ‘I searched this room carefully before lunch.’‘And so did I,’ said Baskerville. ‘Every inch of it.’‘There was certainly no boot in it then.’‘In  that  case  the  waiter  must  have  placed  it  there  while we were lunching.’The  German  was  sent  for  but  professed  to  know  noth-ing of the matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item  had  been  added  to  that  constant  and  apparently  pur-
The Hound of the Baskervilles poseless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other  so  rapidly.  Setting  aside  the  whole  grim  story  of  Sir Charles’s  death,  we  had  a  line  of  inexplicable  incidents  all within the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss  of  the  new  brown  boot,  the  loss  of  the  old  black  boot, and now the return of the new brown boot. Holmes sat in silence  in  the  cab  as  we  drove  back  to  Baker  Street,  and  I knew  from  his  drawn  brows  and  keen  face  that  his  mind, like  my  own,  was  busy  in  endeavouring  to  frame  some scheme into which all these strange and apparently discon-nected episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.Just  before  dinner  two  telegrams  were  handed  in.  The first ran:—‘Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall.—BASKERVILLE.’ The second:—‘Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to re-port unable to trace cut sheet of Times.—CARTWRIGHT.’‘There  go  two  of  my  threads,  Watson.  There  is  nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for another scent.’‘We have still the cabman who drove the spy.’‘Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question.’The  ring  at  the  bell  proved  to  be  something  even  more satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comExperts quickly advised affected users against paying the ransom due to no reports of people getting their data back after payment and as high revenues would encourage more of such campaigns.[46][47][48] As of 14 June 2017, after the attack had subsided, a total of 327 payments totaling US130,634.77 (51.62396539 XBT) had been transferred.[49]

The day after the initial attack in May, Microsoft released out-of-band security updates for end of life products Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 8; these patches had been created in February of that year following a tip off about the vulnerability in January of that year.[50][41] Organizations were advised to patch Windows and plug the vulnerability in order to protect themselves from the cyber attack.[51] The head of Microsoft's Cyber Defense Operations Center, Adrienne Hall, said that "Due to the elevated risk for destructive cyber-attacks at this time, we made the decision to take this action because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks with characteristics similar to WannaCrypt [alternative name to WannaCry]".[52][53]

Researcher Marcus Hutchins[54][55] discovered the kill switch domain hardcoded in the malware.[56][57][58] Registering a domain name for a DNS sinkhole stopped the attack spreading as a worm, because the ransomware only encrypted the computer's files if it was unable to connect to that domain, which all computers infected with WannaCry before the website's registration had been unable to do. While this did not help already infected systems, it severely slowed the spread of the initial infection and gave time for defensive measures to be deployed worldwide, particularly in North America and Asia, which had not been attacked to the same extent as elsewhere.[59][60][61][62][63] On 14 May, a first variant of WannaCry appeared with a new and second[64] kill-switch registered by Matt Suiche on the same day. This was followed by a second variant with the third and last kill-switch on 15 May, which was registered by Check Point threat intelligence analysts.[65][66] A few days later, a new version of WannaCry was detected that lacked the kill switch altogether.[67][68][69][70]

On 19 May, it was reported that hackers were trying to use a Mirai botnet variant to effect a distributed denial-of-service attack on WannaCry's kill-switch domain with the intention of knocking it offline.[71] On 22 May, Hutchins protected the domain by switching to a cached version of the site, capable of dealing with much higher traffic loads than the live site.[72]

Separately, researchers from University College London and Boston University reported that their PayBreak system could defeat WannaCry and several other families of ransomware by recovering the keys used to encrypt the user's data.[73][74]

It was discovered that Windows encryption APIs used by WannaCry may not completely clear the prime numbers used to generate the payload's private keys from the memory, making it potentially possible to retrieve the required key if they had not yet been overwritten or cleared from resident memory. The key is kept in the memory if the WannaCry process has not been killed and the computer has not been rebooted after being infected.[75] This behaviour was used by a French researcher to develop a tool known as WannaKey, which automates this process on Windows XP systems.[76][77][78] This approach was iterated upon by a second tool known as Wanakiwi, which was tested to work on Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 as well.[79]

Within four days of the initial outbreak, new infections had slowed to a trickle due to these responses.[80]
necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper—there would be another one after mid-
night—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join
her own party who were spread around a table on the other
side  of  the  garden.  There  were  three  married  couples  and
Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent
innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner
or  later  Jordan  was  going  to  yield  him  up  her  person  to  a
greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had
preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the
function  of  representing  the  staid  nobility  of  the  country-
side—East  Egg  condescending  to  West  Egg,  and  carefully
on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
‘Let’s get out,’ whispered Jordan, after a somehow waste-
ful and inappropriate half hour. ‘This is much too polite for
me.’
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find
the host—I had never met him, she said, and it was making
me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melan-
choly way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby
was  not  there.  She  couldn’t  find  him  from  the  top  of  the
steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried
an  important-looking  door,  and  walked  into  a  high  Goth-
ic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably
transported complete from some ruin overseas.
A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spec-
tacles  was  sitting  somewhat  drunk  on  the  edge  of  a  great
table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of
The Great Gatsby0
books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and ex-
amined Jordan from head to foot.
‘What do you think?’ he demanded impetuously.
‘About what?’
He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
‘About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to as-
certain. I ascertained. They’re real.’
‘The books?’
He nodded.
‘Absolutely  real—have  pages  and  everything.  I  thought
they’d  be  a  nice  durable  cardboard.  Matter  of  fact,  they’re
absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.’
Taking  our  skepticism  for  granted,  he  rushed  to  the
bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‘Stoddard
Lectures.’
‘See!’  he  cried  triumphantly.  ‘It’s  a  bona  fide  piece  of
printed  matter.  It  fooled  me.  This  fella’s  a  regular  Belasco.
It’s  a  triumph.  What  thoroughness!  What  realism!  Knew
when  to  stop  too—didn’t  cut  the  pages.  But  what  do  you
want? What do you expect?’
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on
its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole
library was liable to collapse.
‘Who brought you?’ he demanded. ‘Or did you just come?
I was brought. Most people were brought.’
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answer-
ing.
‘I  was  brought  by  a  woman  named  Roosevelt,’  he  con-
tinued. ‘Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her

somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now,
and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’
‘Has it?’
‘A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an
hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—
—‘
‘You told us.’
We  shook  hands  with  him  gravely  and  went  back  out-
doors.
There  was  dancing  now  on  the  canvas  in  the  garden,
old  men  pushing  young  girls  backward  in  eternal  grace-
less circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously,
fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great num-
ber  of  single  girls  dancing  individualistically  or  relieving
the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated
tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung
in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’
all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter
rose  toward  the  summer  sky.  A  pair  of  stage  ‘twins’—who
turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in cos-
tume  and  champagne  was  served  in  glasses  bigger  than
finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the
Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the
stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table
with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave
way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laugh-
ter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls
The Great Gatsby
of  champagne  and  the  scene  had  changed  before  my  eyes
into something significant, elemental and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and
smiled.
‘Your  face  is  familiar,’  he  said,  politely.  ‘Weren’t  you  in
the Third Division during the war?’
‘Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.’
‘I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eigh-
teen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.’
We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little vil-
lages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told
me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to
try it out in the morning.
‘Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along
the Sound.’
‘What time?’
‘Any time that suits you best.’
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jor-
dan looked around and smiled.
‘Having a gay time now?’ she inquired.
‘Much  better.’  I  turned  again  to  my  new  acquaintance.
‘This  is  an  unusual  party  for  me.  I  haven’t  even  seen  the
host. I live over there——’ I waved my hand at the invisible
hedge  in  the  distance,  ‘and  this  man  Gatsby  sent  over  his
chauffeur with an invitation.’
For  a  moment  he  looked  at  me  as  if  he  failed  to  under-
stand.
‘I’m Gatsby,’ he said suddenly.
‘What!’ I exclaimed. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon.’

‘I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very
good host.’
He  smiled  understandingly—much  more  than  under-
standingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of
eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or
five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole ex-
ternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU
with  an  irresistible  prejudice  in  your  favor.  It  understood
you  just  so  far  as  you  wanted  to  be  understood,  believed
in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured
you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your
best,  you  hoped  to  convey.  Precisely  at  that  point  it  van-
ished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a
year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech
just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced
himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his
words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified him-
self a butler hurried toward him with the information that
Chicago  was  calling  him  on  the  wire.  He  excused  himself
with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
‘If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,’ he urged
me. ‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.’
When  he  was  gone  I  turned  immediately  to  Jordan—
constrained  to  assure  her  of  my  surprise.  I  had  expected
that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in
his middle years.
‘Who is he?’ I demanded. ‘Do you know?’
‘He’s just a man named Gatsby.’
The Great Gatsby
‘Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?’
‘Now YOU’re started on the subject,’ she answered with
a  wan  smile.  ‘Well,—he  told  me  once  he  was  an  Oxford
man.’
A dim background started to take shape behind him but
at her next remark it faded away.
‘However, I don’t believe it.’
‘Why not?’
‘I  don’t  know,’  she  insisted,  ‘I  just  don’t  think  he  went
there.’
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s ‘I
think he killed a man,’ and had the effect of stimulating my
curiosity. I would have accepted without question the infor-
mation  that  Gatsby  sprang  from  the  swamps  of  Louisiana
or from the lower East Side of New York. That was compre-
hensible.  But  young  men  didn’t—at  least  in  my  provincial
inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of no-
where and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
‘Anyhow  he  gives  large  parties,’  said  Jordan,  changing
the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ‘And I
like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there
isn’t any privacy.’
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the
orchestra  leader  rang  out  suddenly  above  the  echolalia  of
the garden.
‘Ladies  and  gentlemen,’  he  cried.  ‘At  the  request  of  Mr.
Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff ’s
latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie
Hall  last  May.  If  you  read  the  papers  you  know  there  was

a  big  sensation.’  He  smiled  with  jovial  condescension  and
added ‘Some sensation!’ whereupon everybody laughed.
‘The piece is known,’ he concluded lustily, ‘as ‘Vladimir
Tostoff ’s Jazz History of the World.’ ‘
The nature of Mr. Tostoff ’s composition eluded me, be-
cause just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone
on the marble steps and looking from one group to another
with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractive-
ly  tight  on  his  face  and  his  short  hair  looked  as  though  it
were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about
him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped
to  set  him  off  from  his  guests,  for  it  seemed  to  me  that  he
grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When
the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting
their  heads  on  men’s  shoulders  in  a  puppyish,  convivial
way,  girls  were  swooning  backward  playfully  into  men’s
arms,  even  into  groups  knowing  that  some  one  would  ar-
rest  their  falls—but  no  one  swooned  backward  on  Gatsby
and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no sing-
ing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.
‘I beg your pardon.’
Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.
‘Miss  Baker?’  he  inquired.  ‘I  beg  your  pardon  but  Mr.
Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.’
‘With me?’ she exclaimed in surprise.
‘Yes, madame.’
She  got  up  slowly,  raising  her  eyebrows  at  me  in  aston-
ishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed
that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports
The Great Gatsby
clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if
she  had  first  learned  to  walk  upon  golf  courses  on  clean,
crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused
and  intriguing  sounds  had  issued  from  a  long  many-win-
dowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s
undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical con-
versation  with  two  chorus  girls,  and  who  implored  me  to
join him, I went inside.
The  large  room  was  full  of  people.  One  of  the  girls  in
yellow  was  playing  the  piano  and  beside  her  stood  a  tall,
red  haired  young  lady  from  a  famous  chorus,  engaged  in
song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during
the  course  of  her  song  she  had  decided  ineptly  that  every-
thing was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was
weeping  too.  Whenever  there  was  a  pause  in  the  song  she
filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyr-
ic  again  in  a  quavering  soprano.  The  tears  coursed  down
her  cheeks—not  freely,  however,  for  when  they  came  into
contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an
inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black
rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the
notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank
into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
‘She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,’
explained a girl at my elbow.
I  looked  around.  Most  of  the  remaining  women  were
now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even

der by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious
intensity  to  a  young  actress,  and  his  wife  after  attempt-
ing  to  laugh  at  the  situation  in  a  dignified  and  indifferent
way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at
intervals  she  appeared  suddenly  at  his  side  like  an  angry
diamond, and hissed ‘You promised!’ into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward
men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably so-
ber men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were
sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
‘Whenever  he  sees  I’m  having  a  good  time  he  wants  to
go home.’
‘Never heard anything so selfish in my life.’
‘We’re always the first ones to leave.’
‘So are we.’
‘Well, we’re almost the last tonight,’ said one of the men
sheepishly. ‘The orchestra left half an hour ago.’
In  spite  of  the  wives’  agreement  that  such  malevolence
was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short strug-
gle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library
opened  and  Jordan  Baker  and  Gatsby  came  out  together.
He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his
manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people
approached him to say goodbye.
Jordan’s  party  were  calling  impatiently  to  her  from  the
porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
‘I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,’ she whispered.
‘How long were we in there?’
The Great Gatsby
‘Why,—about an hour.’
‘It was—simply amazing,’ she repeated abstractedly. ‘But
I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.’ She
yawned  gracefully  in  my  face.  ‘Please  come  and  see  me....
Phone  book....  Under  the  name  of  Mrs.  Sigourney  How-
ard.... My aunt....’ She was hurrying off as she talked—her
brown  hand  waved  a  jaunty  salute  as  she  melted  into  her
party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed
so  late,  I  joined  the  last  of  Gatsby’s  guests  who  were  clus-
tered  around  him.  I  wanted  to  explain  that  I’d  hunted  for
him  early  in  the  evening  and  to  apologize  for  not  having
known him in the garden.
‘Don’t mention it,’ he enjoined me eagerly. ‘Don’t give it
another thought, old sport.’ The familiar expression held no
more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed
my shoulder. ‘And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydro-
plane tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’
Then the butler, behind his shoulder:
‘Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.’
‘All  right,  in  a  minute.  Tell  them  I’ll  be  right  there....
good night.’
‘Good night.’
‘Good  night.’  He  smiled—and  suddenly  there  seemed
to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last
to  go,  as  if  he  had  desired  it  all  the  time.  ‘Good  night,  old
sport.... Good night.’
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was
not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights

illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch be-
side the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel,
rested  a  new  coup  which  had  left  Gatsby’s  drive  not  two
minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the de-
tachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable
attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as
they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant
din from those in the rear had been audible for some time
and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck
and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the
car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleas-
ant, puzzled way.
‘See!’ he explained. ‘It went in the ditch.’
The  fact  was  infinitely  astonishing  to  him—and  I  rec-
ognized  first  the  unusual  quality  of  wonder  and  then  the
man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.
‘How’d it happen?’
He shrugged his shoulders.
‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics,’ he said de-
cisively.
‘But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?’
‘Don’t ask me,’ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the
whole  matter.  ‘I  know  very  little  about  driving—next  to
nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.’
‘Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving
at night.’
‘But  I  wasn’t  even  trying,’  he  explained  indignantly,  ‘I
wasn’t even trying.’
The Great Gatsby0
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
‘Do you want to commit suicide?’
‘You’re  lucky  it  was  just  a  wheel!  A  bad  driver  and  not
even TRYing!’
‘You don’t understand,’ explained the criminal. ‘I wasn’t
driving. There’s another man in the car.’
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in
a sustained ‘Ah-h-h!’ as the door of the coup swung slowly
open.  The  crowd—it  was  now  a  crowd—stepped  back  in-
voluntarily and when the door had opened wide there was
a  ghostly  pause.  Then,  very  gradually,  part  by  part,  a  pale
dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tenta-
tively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded  by  the  glare  of  the  headlights  and  confused  by
the  incessant  groaning  of  the  horns  the  apparition  stood
swaying  for  a  moment  before  he  perceived  the  man  in  the
duster.
‘Wha’s  matter?’  he  inquired  calmly.  ‘Did  we  run  outa
gas?’
‘Look!’
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he
stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though
he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
‘It came off,’ some one explained.
He nodded.
‘At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.’
A  pause.  Then,  taking  a  long  breath  and  straightening
his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:
‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?’

 He shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it. "Any
good?" he said.  "This sentence I'm reading is terrific." I can be quite sarcastic when I'm in the
mood. He didn't get It, though. He started walking around the room again, picking up all
my personal stuff, and Stradlater's. Finally, I put my book down on the floor. You
couldn't read anything with a guy like Ackley around. It was impossible.  I slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old Ackley making himself at
home. I was feeling sort of tired from the trip to New York and all, and I started yawning.
Then I started horsing around a little bit. Sometimes I horse around quite a lot, just to
keep from getting bored. What I did was, I pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around
to the front, then pulled it way down over my eyes. That way, I couldn't see a goddam
thing. "I think I'm going blind," I said in this very hoarse voice. "Mother darling,
everything's getting so dark in here."  "You're nuts. I swear to God," Ackley said.  "Mother darling, give me your hand, Why won't you give me your hand?"  "For Chrissake, grow up."  I started groping around in front of me, like a blind guy, but without getting up or
anything. I kept saying, "Mother darling, why won't you give me your hand?" I was only
horsing around, naturally. That stuff gives me a bang sometimes. Besides, I know it
annoyed hell out of old Ackley. He always brought out the old sadist in me. I was pretty
sadistic with him quite often. Finally, I quit, though. I pulled the peak around to the back
again, and relaxed.  "Who belongsa this?" Ackley said. He was holding my roommate's knee
supporter up to show me. That guy Ackley'd pick up anything. He'd even pick up your
jock strap or something. I told him it was Stradlater's. So he chucked it on Stradlater's
bed. He got it off Stradlater's chiffonier, so he chucked it on the bed.  He came over and sat down on the arm of Stradlater's chair. He never sat down in
a chair. Just always on the arm. "Where the hellja get that hat?" he said.  "New York."  "How much?"  "A buck."  "You got robbed." He started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a
match. He was always cleaning his fingernails. It was funny, in a way. His teeth were
always mossy-looking, and his ears were always dirty as hell, but he was always cleaning
his fingernails. I guess he thought that made him a very neat guy. He took another look at
my hat while he was cleaning them. "Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in,
for Chrissake," he said. "That's a deer shooting hat."  "Like hell it is." I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was
taking aim at it. "This is a people shooting hat," I said. "I shoot people in this hat."  "Your folks know you got kicked out yet?"  "Nope."  "Where the hell's Stradlater at, anyway?"  "Down at the game. He's got a date." I yawned. I was yawning all over the place.

For one thing, the room was too damn hot. It made you sleepy. At Pencey, you either
froze to death or died of the heat.
 "The great Stradlater," Ackley said. "--Hey. Lend me your scissors a second,
willya? Ya got 'em handy?"  "No. I packed them already. They're way in the top of the closet."  "Get 'em a second, willya?" Ackley said, "I got this hangnail I want to cut off."  He didn't care if you'd packed something or not and had it way in the top of the
closet. I got them for him though. I nearly got killed doing it, too. The second I opened
the closet door, Stradlater's tennis racket--in its wooden press and all--fell right on my
head. It made a big clunk, and it hurt like hell. It damn near killed old Ackley, though. He
started laughing in this very high falsetto voice. He kept laughing the whole time I was
taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him. Something like that--a guy
getting hit on the head with a rock or something--tickled the pants off Ackley. "You have
a damn good sense of humor, Ackley kid," I told him. "You know that?" I handed him the
scissors. "Lemme be your manager. I'll get you on the goddam radio." I sat down in my
chair again, and he started cutting his big horny-looking nails. "How 'bout using the table
or something?" I said. "Cut 'em over the table, willya? I don't feel like walking on your
crumby nails in my bare feet tonight." He kept right on cutting them over the floor,
though. What lousy manners. I mean it.  "Who's Stradlater's date?" he said. He was always keeping tabs on who Stradlater
was dating, even though he hated Stradlater's guts.  "I don't know. Why?"  "No reason. Boy, I can't stand that sonuvabitch. He's one sonuvabitch I really can't
stand."  "He's crazy about you. He told me he thinks you're a goddam prince," I said. I call
people a "prince" quite often when I'm horsing around. It keeps me from getting bored or
something.  "He's got this superior attitude all the time," Ackley said. "I just can't stand the
sonuvabitch. You'd think he--"  "Do you mind cutting your nails over the table, hey?" I said. "I've asked you about
fifty--"  "He's got this goddam superior attitude all the time," Ackley said. "I don't even
think the sonuvabitch is intelligent. He thinks he is. He thinks he's about the most--"  "Ackley! For Chrissake. Willya please cut your crumby nails over the table? I've
asked you fifty times."  He started cutting his nails over the table, for a change. The only way he ever did
anything was if you yelled at him.  I watched him for a while. Then I said, "The reason you're sore at Stradlater is
because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while. He didn't mean to
insult you, for cryin' out loud. He didn't say it right or anything, but he didn't mean
anything insulting. All he meant was you'd look better and feel better if you sort of
brushed your teeth once in a while."  "I brush my teeth. Don't gimme that."  "No, you don't. I've seen you, and you don't," I said. I didn't say it nasty, though. I
felt sort of sorry for him, in a way. I mean it isn't too nice, naturally, if somebody tells
you you don't brush your teeth. "Stradlater's all right He's not too bad," I said. "You don't
know him, thats the trouble."  "I still say he's a sonuvabitch. He's a conceited sonuvabitch."
 "He's conceited, but he's very generous in some things. He really is," I said.
"Look. Suppose, for instance, Stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked.
Say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot--I'm just giving you an example, now.
You know what he'd do? He'd probably take it off and give it ta you. He really would.
Or--you know what he'd do? He'd leave it on your bed or something. But he'd give you
the goddam tie. Most guys would probably just--"  "Hell," Ackley said. "If I had his dough, I would, too."  "No, you wouldn't." I shook my head. "No, you wouldn't, Ackley kid. If you had
his dough, you'd be one of the biggest--"  "Stop calling me 'Ackley kid,' God damn it. I'm old enough to be your lousy
father."  "No, you're not." Boy, he could really be aggravating sometimes. He never missed
a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen. "In the first place, I
wouldn't let you in my goddam family," I said.  "Well, just cut out calling me--"  All of a sudden the door opened, and old Stradlater barged in, in a big hurry. He
was always in a big hurry. Everything was a very big deal. He came over to me and gave
me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks--which is something that can be very
annoying. 'Listen," he said. "You going out anywheres special tonight?"  "I don't know. I might. What the hell's it doing out--snowing?" He had snow all
over his coat.  "Yeah. Listen. If you're not going out anyplace special, how 'bout lending me
your hound's-tooth jacket?"  "Who won the game?" I said.  "It's only the half. We're leaving," Stradlater said. "No kidding, you gonna use
your hound's-tooth tonight or not? I spilled some crap all over my gray flannel."  "No, but I don't want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all," I
said. We were practically the same heighth, but he weighed about twice as much as I did.
He had these very broad shoulders.  "I won't stretch it." He went over to the closet in a big hurry. "How'sa boy,
Ackley?" he said to Ackley. He was at least a pretty friendly guy, Stradlater. It was partly
a phony kind of friendly, but at least he always said hello to Ackley and all.  Ackley just sort of grunted when he said "How'sa boy?" He wouldn't answer him,
but he didn't have guts enough not to at least grunt. Then he said to me, "I think I'll get
going. See ya later."  "Okay," I said. He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own
room.  Old Stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all. "I think maybe I'll take a
fast shave," he said. He had a pretty heavy beard. He really did.  "Where's your date?" I asked him.  "She's waiting in the Annex." He went out of the room with his toilet kit and
towel under his arm. No shirt on or anything. He always walked around in his bare torso
because he thought he had a damn good build. He did, too. I have to admit it.   4
  I didn't have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the rag
with him while he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because everybody
was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There
were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat
down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off--this
nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling 'Song of India" while he shaved. He had
one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always
picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler, like "Song of
India" or "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue." He could really mess a song up.  You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well,
so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always
looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved
himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never
cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up,
but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed
himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself. He thought he
was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was pretty handsome, too--I'll
admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his
picture in your Year Book, they'd right away say, "Who's this boy?" I mean he was
mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were
a lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they wouldn't look handsome if you saw their
pictures in the Year Book. They'd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out. I've
had that experience frequently.  Anyway, I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving, sort
of turning the water on and off. I still had my red hunting hat on, with the peak around to
the back and all. I really got a bang out of that hat.  "Hey," Stradlater said. "Wanna do me a big favor?"  "What?" I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big
favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he's a real hot-shot, and they're
always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they're crazy about themseif, they
think you're crazy about them, too, and that you're just dying to do them a favor. It's sort
of funny, in a way.  "You goin' out tonight?" he said.  "I might. I might not. I don't know. Why?"  "I got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday," he said. "How 'bout
writing a composition for me, for English? I'll be up the creek if I don't get the goddam
thing in by Monday, the reason I ask. How 'bout it?"   It was very ironical. It really was.  "I'm the one that's flunking out of the goddam place, and you're asking me to
write you a goddam composition," I said.  "Yeah, I know. The thing is, though, I'll be up the creek if I don't get it in. Be a
buddy. Be a buddyroo. Okay?"  I didn't answer him right away. Suspense is good for some bastards like
Stradlater.  "What on?" I said.
 "Anything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once
lived in or something-- you know. Just as long as it's descriptive as hell." He gave out a
big yawn while he said that. Which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass. I
mean if somebody yawns right while they're asking you to do them a goddam favor. "Just
don't do it too good, is all," he said. "That sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks you're a hot-shot in
English, and he knows you're my roommate. So I mean don't stick all the commas and
stuff in the right place."  That's something else that gives me a royal pain. I mean if you're good at writing
compositions and somebody starts talking about commas. Stradlater was always doing
that. He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions
was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place. He was a little bit like Ackley,
that way. I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game. We had a terrific guy on the
team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the middle of the floor, without even
touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept saying, the whole goddam game, that
Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God, how I hate that stuff.  I got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while, so I backed up a few feet and
started doing this tap dance, just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself. I can't really
tap-dance or anything, but it was a stone floor in the can, and it was good for tap-dancing.
I started imitating one of those guys in the movies. In one of those musicals. I hate the
movies like poison, but I get a bang imitating them. Old Stradlater watched me in the
mirror while he was shaving. All I need's an audience. I'm an exhibitionist. "I'm the
goddarn Governor's son," I said. I was knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the
place. "He doesn't want me to be a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it's in
my goddam blood, tap-dancing." Old Stradlater laughed. He didn't have too bad a sense
of humor. "It's the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies." I was getting out of breath. I
have hardly any wind at all. "The leading man can't go on. He's drunk as a bastard. So
who do they get to take his place? Me, that's who. The little ole goddam Governor's son."  "Where'dja get that hat?" Stradlater said. He meant my hunting hat. He'd never
seen it before.  I was out of breath anyway, so I quit horsing around. I took off my hat and looked
at it for about the ninetieth time. "I got it in New York this morning. For a buck. Ya like
it?"  Stradlater nodded. "Sharp," he said. He was only flattering me, though, because
right away he said, "Listen. Are ya gonna write that composition for me? I have to
know."  "If I get the time, I will. If I don't, I won't," I said. I went over and sat down at the
washbowl next to him again. "Who's your date?" I asked him. "Fitzgerald?"  "Hell, no! I told ya. I'm through with that pig."  "Yeah? Give her to me, boy. No kidding. She's my type."  "Take her . . . She's too old for you."  All of a sudden--for no good reason, really, except that I was sort of in the mood
for horsing around--I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater in a
half nelson. That's a wrestling hold, in case you don't know, where you get the other guy
around the neck and choke him to death, if you feel like it. So I did it. I landed on him
like a goddam panther.
 "Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!" Stradlater said. He didn't feel like horsing
around. He was shaving and all. "Wuddaya wanna make me do--cut my goddam head
off?"  I didn't let go, though. I had a pretty good half nelson on him. "Liberate yourself
from my viselike grip." I said.  "Je-sus Christ." He put down his razor, and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and
sort of broke my hold on him. He was a very strong guy. I'm a very weak guy. "Now, cut
out the crap," he said. He started shaving himself all over again. He always shaved
himself twice, to look gorgeous. With his crumby old razor.  "Who is your date if it isn't Fitzgerald?" I asked him. I sat down on the washbowl
next to him again. "That Phyllis Smith babe?"  "No. It was supposed to he, but the arrangements got all screwed up. I got Bud
Thaw's girl's roommate now . . . Hey. I almost forgot. She knows you."  "Who does?" I said.   "My date."  "Yeah?" I said. "What's her name?" I was pretty interested.  "I'm thinking . . . Uh. Jean Gallagher."   Boy, I nearly dropped dead when he said that.  "Jane Gallagher," I said. I even got up from the washbowl when he said that. I
damn near dropped dead. "You're damn right I know her. She practically lived right next
door to me, the summer before last. She had this big damn Doberman pinscher. That's
how I met her. Her dog used to keep coming over in our--"  "You're right in my light, Holden, for Chrissake," Stradlater said. "Ya have to
stand right there?"  Boy, was I excited, though. I really was.  "Where is she?" I asked him. "I oughta go down and say hello to her or
something. Where is she? In the Annex?"  "Yeah."  "How'd she happen to mention me? Does she go to B.M. now? She said she might
go there. She said she might go to Shipley, too. I thought she went to Shipley. How'd she
happen to mention me?" I was pretty excited. I really was.  "I don't know, for Chrissake. Lift up, willya? You're on my towel," Stradlater
said. I was sitting on his stupid towel.  "Jane Gallagher," I said. I couldn't get over it. "Jesus H. Christ."  Old Stradlater was putting Vitalis on his hair. My Vitalis.   "She's a dancer," I said. "Ballet and all. She used to practice about two hours
every day, right in the middle of the hottest weather and all. She was worried that it might
make her legs lousy--all thick and all. I used to play checkers with her all the time."  "You used to play what with her all the time?"  "Checkers."  "Checkers, for Chrissake!"  "Yeah. She wouldn't move any of her kings. What she'd do, when she'd get a king,
she wouldn't move it. She'd just leave it in the back row. She'd get them all lined up in the
back row. Then she'd never use them. She just liked the way they looked when they were
all in the back row."  Stradlater didn't say anything. That kind of stuff doesn't interest most people.
 "Her mother belonged to the same club we did," I said. "I used to caddy once in a
while, just to make some dough. I caddy'd for her mother a couple of times. She went
around in about a hundred and seventy, for nine holes."  Stradlater wasn't hardly listening. He was combing his gorgeous locks.  "I oughta go down and at least say hello to her," I said.  "Why don'tcha?"  "I will, in a minute."  He started parting his hair all over again. It took him about an hour to comb his
hair.  "Her mother and father were divorced. Her mother was married again to some
booze hound," I said. "Skinny guy with hairy legs. I remember him. He wore shorts all
the time. Jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing, but all I
ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery
program on the radio. And run around the goddam house, naked. With Jane around, and
all."  "Yeah?" Stradlater said. That really interested him. About the booze hound
running around the house naked, with Jane around. Stradlater was a very sexy bastard.  "She had a lousy childhood. I'm not kidding."  That didn't interest Stradlater, though. Only very sexy stuff interested him.  "Jane Gallagher. Jesus . . . I couldn't get her off my mind. I really couldn't. "I
oughta go down and say hello to her, at least."  "Why the hell don'tcha, instead of keep saying it?" Stradlater said.   I walked over to the window, but you couldn't see out of it, it was so steamy from
all the heat in the can.. "I'm not in the mood right now," I said. I wasn't, either. You have
to be in the mood for those things. "I thought she went to Shipley. I could've sworn she
went to Shipley." I walked around the can for a little while. I didn't have anything else to
do. "Did she enjoy the game?" I said.  "Yeah, I guess so. I don't know."  "Did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time, or anything?"  "I don't know. For Chrissake, I only just met her," Stradlater said. He was finished
combing his goddam gorgeous hair. He was putting away all his crumby toilet articles.  "Listen. Give her my regards, willya?"  "Okay," Stradlater said, but I knew he probably wouldn't. You take a guy like
Stradlater, they never  give your regards to people.   He went back to the room, but I stuck around in the can for a while, thinking
about old Jane. Then I went back to the room, too.  Stradlater was putting on his tie, in front of the mirror, when I got there. He spent
around half his goddam life in front of the mirror. I sat down in my chair and sort of
watched him for a while.  "Hey," I said. "Don't tell her I got kicked out, willya?"  "Okay."  That was one good thing about Stradlater. You didn't have to explain every
goddam little thing with him, the way you had to do with Ackley. Mostly, I guess,
because he wasn't too interested. That's really why. Ackley, it was different. Ackley was
a very nosy bastard.  He put on my hound's-tooth jacket.
 "Jesus, now, try not to stretch it all over the place" I said. I'd only worn it about
twice.  "I won't. Where the hell's my cigarettes?"  "On the desk." He never knew where he left anything. "Under your muffler." He
put them in his coat pocket--my coat pocket.  I pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden, for a
change. I was getting sort of nervous, all of a sudden. I'm quite a nervous guy. "Listen,
where ya going on your date with her?" I asked him. "Ya know yet?"  "I don't know. New York, if we have time. She only signed out for nine-thirty, for
Chrissake."  I didn't like the way he said it, so I said, "The reason she did that, she probably
just didn't know what a handsome, charming bastard you are. If she'd known, she
probably would've signed out for nine-thirty in the morning."  "Goddam right," Stradlater said. You couldn't rile him too easily. He was too
conceited. "No kidding, now. Do that composition for me," he said. He had his coat on,
and he was all ready to go. "Don't knock yourself out or anything, but just make it
descriptive as hell. Okay?"  I didn't answer him. I didn't feel like it. All I said was, "Ask her if she still keeps
all her kings in the back row."  "Okay," Stradlater said, but I knew he wouldn't. "Take it easy, now." He banged
the hell out of the room.  I sat there for about a half hour after he left. I mean I just sat in my chair, not
doing anything. I kept thinking about Jane, and about Stradlater having a date with her
and all. It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy. I already told you what a sexy bastard
Stradlater was.  All of a sudden, Ackley barged back in again, through the damn shower curtains,
as usual. For once in my stupid life, I was really glad to see him. He took my mind off the
other stuff.  He stuck around till around dinnertime, talking about all the guys at Pencey that
he hated their guts, and squeezing this big pimple on his chin. He didn't even use his
handkerchief. I don't even think the bastard had a handkerchief, if you want to know the
truth. I never saw him use one, anyway.   5   We always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey. It was supposed to
be a big deal, because they gave you steak. I'll bet a thousand bucks the reason they did
that was because a lot of guys' parents came up to school on Sunday, and old Thurmer
probably figured everybody's mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner
last night, and he'd say, "Steak." What a racket. You should've seen the steaks. They were
these little hard, dry jobs that you could hardly even cut. You always got these very
lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night, and for dessert you got Brown Betty, which
nobody ate, except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didn't know any better--
and guys like Ackley that ate everything.
 It was nice, though, when we got out of the dining room. There were about three
inches of snow on the ground, and it was still coming down like a madman. It looked
pretty as hell, and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the
place. It was very childish, but everybody was really enjoying themselves.  I didn't have a date or anything, so I and this friend of mine, Mal Brossard, that
was on the wrestling team, decided we'd take a bus into Agerstown and have a hamburger
and maybe see a lousy movie. Neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night. I
asked Mal if he minded if Ackley came along with us. The reason I asked was because
Ackley never did anything on Saturday night, except stay in his room and squeeze his
pimples or something. Mal said he didn't mind but that he wasn't too crazy about the idea.
He didn't like Ackley much. Anyway, we both went to our rooms to get ready and all,
and while I was putting on my galoshes and crap, I yelled over and asked old Ackley if
he wanted to go to the movies. He could hear me all right through the shower curtains,
but he didn't answer me right away. He was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you
right away. Finally he came over, through the goddam curtains, and stood on the shower
ledge and asked who was going besides me. He always had to know who was going. I
swear, if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere, and you rescued him in a goddam boat,
he'd want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he'd even get in. I told him
Mal Brossard was going. He said, "That bastard . . . All right. Wait a second." You'd
think he was doing you a big favor.  It took him about five hours to get ready. While he was doing it, I went over to
my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands. The snow was
very good for packing. I didn't throw it at anything, though. I started to throw it. At a car
that was parked across the street. But I changed my mind. The car looked so nice and
white. Then I started to throw it at a hydrant, but that looked too nice and white, too.
Finally I didn't throw it at anything. All I did was close the window and walk around the
room with the snowball, packing it harder. A little while later, I still had it with me when
I and Brossnad and Ackley got on the bus. The bus driver opened the doors and made me
throw it out. I told him I wasn't going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn't believe me.
People never believe you.  Brossard and Ackley both had seen the picture that was playing, so all we did, we
just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while, then
took the bus back to Pencey. I didn't care about not seeing the movie, anyway. It was
supposed to be a comedy, with Cary Grant in it, and all that crap. Besides, I'd been to the
movies with Brossard and Ackley before. They both laughed like hyenas at stuff that
wasn't even funny. I didn't even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies.  It was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm. Old Brossard
was a bridge fiend, and he started looking around the dorm for a game. Old Ackley
parked himself in my room, just for a change. Only, instead of sitting on the arm of
Stradlater's chair, he laid down on my bed, with his face right on my pillow and all. He
started talking in this very monotonous voice, and picking at all his pimples. I dropped
about a thousand hints, but I couldn't get rid of him. All he did was keep talking in this
very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse
with the summer before. He'd already told me about it about a hundred times. Every time
he told it, it was different. One minute he'd be giving it to her in his cousin's Buick, the
next minute he'd be giving it to her under some boardwalk. It was all a lot of crap,
naturally. He was a virgin if ever I saw one. I doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel.
Anyway, finally I had to come right out and tell him that I had to write a composition for
Stradlater, and that he had to clear the hell out, so I could concentrate. He finally did, but
he took his time about it, as usual. After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and
my old hunting hat, and started writing the composition.  The thing was, I couldn't think of a room or a house or anything to describe the
way Stradlater said he had to have. I'm not too crazy about describing rooms and houses
anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt. It was a very
descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed fielder's mitt. He
was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though, was that he had poems
written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink. He wrote them
on it so that he'd have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at
bat. He's dead now. He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18,
1946. You'd have liked him. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty
times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing
letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their
class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that
he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways.
He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily,
but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had. I
started playing golf when I was only ten years old. I remember once, the summer I was
around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a
sudden, I'd see Allie. So I did, and sure enough, he was sitting on his bike outside the
fence--there was this fence that went all around the course--and he was sitting there,
about a hundred and fifty yards behind me, watching me tee off. That's the kind of red
hair he had. God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he
thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair. I was only thirteen, and
they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in
the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I
broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all
the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken
and everything by that time, and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll
admit, but I hardly didn't even know I was doing it, and you didn't know Allie. My hand
still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all, and I can't make a real fist any more--
not a tight one, I mean--but outside of that I don't care much. I mean I'm not going to be a
goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway.  Anyway, that's what I wrote Stradlater's composition about. Old Allie's baseball
mitt. I happened to have it with me, in my suitcase, so I got it out and copied down the
poems that were written on it. All I had to do was change Allie's name so that nobody
would know it was my brother and not Stradlater's. I wasn't too crazy about doing it, but I
couldn't think of anything else descriptive. Besides, I sort of liked writing about it. It took
me about an hour, because I had to use Stradlater's lousy typewriter, and it kept jamming
on me. The reason I didn't use my own was because I'd lent it to a guy down the hall.  It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it. I wasn't tired, though, so I
looked out the window for a while. It wasn't snowing out any more, but every once in a
while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started. You could also hear

Chapter I
The  studio  was  filled  with  the  rich  odor  of  roses,  and
when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the
garden there came through the open door the heavy scent
of  the  lilac,  or  the  more  delicate  perfume  of  the  pink-
flowering thorn.
From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on
which he was lying, smoking, as usual, innumerable
cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam
of  the  honey-sweet  and  honey-colored  blossoms  of  the
laburnum,  whose  tremulous  branches  seemed  hardly  able
to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and
now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted
across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in
front of the huge window, producing a kind of
momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those
pallid jade-faced painters who, in  an  art  that  is  necessarily
immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and
motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their
way  through  the  long  unmown  grass,  or  circling  with
monotonous insistence round the black-crocketed spires of
the  early  June  hollyhocks,  seemed  to  make  the  stillness

more oppressive, and the dim roar of London was like the
bourdon note of a distant organ.
In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel,
stood the full-length portrait of a young man of
extraordinary  personal  beauty,  and  in  front  of  it,  some
little  distance  away,  was  sitting  the  artist  himself,  Basil
Hallward,  whose  sudden  disappearance  some  years  ago
caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise
to so many strange conjectures.
As  he  looked  at  the  gracious  and  comely  form  he  had
so  skilfully  mirrored  in  his  art,  a  smile  of  pleasure  passed
across  his  face,  and  seemed  about  to  linger  there.  But  he
suddenly  started  up,  and,  closing  his  eyes,  placed  his
fingers  upon  the  lids,  as  though  he  sought  to  imprison
within his brain some curious dream from which he feared
he might awake.
‘It  is  your  best  work,  Basil,  the  best  thing  you  have
ever done,’ said Lord Henry, languidly. ‘You must
certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The
Academy is too large and too vulgar. The Grosvenor is the
only place.’
‘I  don’t  think  I  will  send  it  anywhere,’  he  answered,
tossing  his  head  back  in  that  odd  way  that  used  to  make
The Picture of Dorian Gray

his  friends  laugh  at  him  at  Oxford.  ‘No:  I  won’t  send  it
anywhere.’
Lord  Henry  elevated  his  eyebrows,  and  looked  at  him
in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that
curled  up  in  such  fanciful  whorls  from  his  heavy  opium-
tainted  cigarette.  ‘Not  send  it  anywhere?  My  dear  fellow,
why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters
are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As
soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.
It  is  silly  of  you,  for  there  is  only  one  thing  in  the  world
worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked
about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the
young  men  in  England,  and  make  the  old  men  quite
jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.’
‘I know you will laugh at me,’ he replied, ‘but I really
can’t exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.’
Lord  Henry  stretched  his  long  legs  out  on  the  divan
and shook with laughter.
‘Yes,  I  knew  you  would  laugh;  but  it  is  quite  true,  all
the same.’
‘Too  much  of  yourself  in  it!  Upon  my  word,  Basil,  I
didn’t  know  you  were  so  vain;  and  I  really  can’t  see  any
resemblance  between  you,  with  your  rugged  strong  face
and  your  coal-black  hair,  and  this  young  Adonis,  who

and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to
dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better
not  to  be  different  from  one’s  fellows.  The  ugly  and  the
stupid  have  the  best  of  it  in  this  world.  They  can  sit
quietly  and  gape  at  the  play.  If  they  know  nothing  of
victory,  they  are  at  least  spared  the  knowledge  of  defeat.
They  live  as  we  all  should  live,  undisturbed,  indifferent,
and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others
nor  ever  receive  it  from  alien  hands.  Your  rank  and
wealth,  Harry;  my  brains,  such  as  they  are,—my  fame,
whatever  it  may  be  worth;  Dorian  Gray’s  good  looks,—
we  will  all  suffer  for  what  the  gods  have  given  us,  suffer
terribly.’
‘Dorian  Gray?  is  that  his  name?’  said  Lord  Henry,
walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.
‘Yes; that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.’
‘But why not?’
‘Oh,  I  can’t  explain.  When  I  like  people  immensely  I
never tell their names to any one. It seems like
surrendering  a  part  of  them.  You  know  how  I  love
secrecy.  It  is  the  only  thing  that  can  make  modern  life
wonderful  or  mysterious  to  us.  The  commonest  thing  is
delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town I never
tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all

‘Being  natural  is  simply  a  pose,  and  the  most  irritating
pose  I  know,’  cried  Lord  Henry,  laughing;  and  the  two
young  men  went  out  into  the  garden  together,  and  for  a
time they did not speak.
After a long pause Lord Henry pulled out his watch. ‘I
am  afraid  I  must  be  going,  Basil,’  he  murmured,  ‘and
before I go I insist on your answering a question I put to
you some time ago.’
‘What  is  that?’  asked  Basil  Hallward,  keeping  his  eyes
fixed on the ground.
‘You know quite well.’
‘I do not, Harry.’
‘Well, I will tell you what it is.’
‘Please don’t.’
‘I  must.  I  want  you  to  explain  to  me  why  you  won’t
exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.’
‘I told you the real reason.’
‘No,  you  did  not.  You  said  it  was  because  there  was
too much of yourself in it. Now, that is childish.’
‘Harry,’ said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the
face, ‘every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait
of  the  artist,  not  of  the  sitter.  The  sitter  is  merely  the
accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the
painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas,

‘Well, this is incredible,’ repeated Hallward, rather
bitterly,— ‘incredible to me at times. I don’t know what it
means.  The  story  is  simply  this.  Two  months  ago  I  went
to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor painters
have  to  show  ourselves  in  society  from  time  to  time,  just
to  remind  the  public  that  we  are  not  savages.  With  an
evening  coat  and  a  white  tie,  as  you  told  me  once,
anybody,  even  a  stock-broker,  can  gain  a  reputation  for
being  civilized.  Well,  after  I  had  been  in  the  room  about
ten  minutes,  talking  to  huge  overdressed  dowagers  and
tedious  Academicians,  I  suddenly  became  conscious  that
some  one  was  looking  at  me.  I  turned  half-way  round,
and  saw  Dorian  Gray  for  the  first  time.  When  our  eyes
met,  I  felt  that  I  was  growing  pale.  A  curious  instinct  of
terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face
with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating
that,  if  I  allowed  it  to  do  so,  it  would  absorb  my  whole
nature,  my  whole  soul,  my  very  art  itself.  I  did  not  want
any  external  influence  in  my  life.  You  know  yourself,
Harry, how independent I am by nature. My father
destined  me  for  the  army.  I  insisted  on  going  to  Oxford.
Then he made me enter my name at the Middle Temple.
Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up the Bar,
and  announced  my  intention  of  becoming  a  painter.  I

stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of those
who  called  themselves  Methodists  at  the  hands  of  their  more  liberal
brethren, and as Simon called hims elf a Methodist, he worked his way
across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to
Mobile, and up the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley’s strictures
on  the  use  of  many  words  in  buying  and  selling,  Simon  made  a  pile
practicing  medicine,  but  in  this  pursuit  he  was  unhappy  lest  he  be
tempted  into  doing  what  he  knew  was  not  for  the  glory  of  God,  as  the
putting  on  of  gold  and  costly  apparel.  So  Simon,  having  forgotten  his
teacher’s  dictum  on  the  possession  of  human  chattels,  bought  three
slaves  and  with  their  aid  established  a  homestead  on  the  banks  of  the
Alabama  River some  forty  miles  above Saint  Stephens. He  returned  to
Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and with her established a line
that  ran  high  to  daughters.  Simon  lived  to  an   impressive  age  and  died
rich.
It  was  customary  for  the  men  in  the  family  to  remain  on  Simon ’s
homestead,  Finch’s  Landing,  and  make  their  living  from  cotton.  The
place was self-sufficient: modest in comparison with the empires
around  it,  the  Landing  nevertheless  produced  everything  required  to
sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles of clothing, supplied by
river-boats from Mobile.
Simon  would  have  regarded  with  impotent  fury  the  disturbance
between the North and the South, as it left his descend ants stripped of

remained  unbroken  until  well  into  the  twentieth  century,  when  my
father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger
brother  went  to  Boston  to  study  medicine.  Their  sister  Alexandra  was
the  Finch  who  remained  at  the  Landing:  she  married  a  taciturn  man
who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering
if his trot-lines were full.
When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Mayc omb
and  began  his  practice.  Maycomb,  some  twenty  miles  east  of  Finch ’s
Landing,  was  the  county  seat  of  Maycomb  County.  Atticus ’s  office  in
the  courthouse  contained  little  more  than  a  hat  rack,  a  spittoon,  a
checkerboard  and  an  unsullied  Code  of  Alabama.  Hi s  first  two  clients
were  the  last  two  persons  hanged  in  the  Maycomb  County  jail.  Atticus
had  urged  them  to  accept  the  state’s  generosity  in  allowing  them  to
plead  Guilty  to  second -degree  murder  and  escape  with  their  lives,  but
they  were  Haverfords,  in  Maycomb  County  a  name  synonymous  with
jackass. The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb’s leading blacksmith
in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a
mare, were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three
witnesses,  and  insisted  that  the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming -to -him
was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in pleading Not
Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus could
do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that
was  probably  the  beginning  of  my  father’s  profound  distaste  for  the
practice of criminal law.
During  his  first  five  years  in  Maycomb,  Atticus  practiced  economy
more than anything; for several years thereafter he invested his
earnings  in  his  brother’s  education.  John  Hale  Finch  was  ten  years
younger  than  my  father,  and  chose  to  study  medicine  at  a  time  when
cotton  was  not  worth  growing;  but  after  getting  Uncle  Jack  started,
Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked Maycomb,
he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew
him,  and  because  of  Simon  Finch ’s  industry,  Atticus  was  related  by
blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town.
Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first
knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop;  grass grew on
the  sidewalks,  the  courthouse  sagged  in  the  square.  Somehow,  it  was
hotter  then:  a  black  dog  suffered  on  a  summer ’s  day;  bony  mules
hitched  to  Hoover  carts  flicked  flies  in  the  sweltering  shade  of   the  live
oaks  on  the  square.  Men ’s  stiff  collars  wilted  by  nine  in  the  morning.
Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o’clock naps, and by
nightfall  were  like  soft  teacakes  with  frostings  of  sweat  and  sweet
talcum.
People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled
in  and  out  of  the  stores  around  it,  took  their  time  about  everything.  A
day  was  twenty-four  hours  long  but  seemed  longer.  There  was  no
hurry,  for  there  was  nowhere  to  go,  nothing  to  buy  and  no  money  to
buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.
But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb
County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.
We lived on the main residential street in town—Atticus, Jem and I,
plus  Calpurnia  our  cook.  Jem  and  I  found  our  father  satisfactory:  he
played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.
Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones;
she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and
twice  as  hard.  She  was  always  ordering  me  out  of  the  kitchen,  asking
me why I couldn ’t behave as well as Jem when she knew he was older,
and  calling  me  home  when  I  wasn ’t  ready  to  come.  Our  battles  were
epic  and  one -sided.  Calpurnia   always  won,  mainly  because  Atticus
always  took  her  side.  She  had  been  with  us  ever  since  Jem  was  born,
and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember.
Our  mother  died  when  I  was  two,  so  I  never  felt  her  absence.  She
was  a  Graham  from  Montgomery;  Atticus  met  her  when  he  was  first
elected  to  the  state  legislature.  He  was  middle-aged  then,  she  was
fifteen  years  his  junior.  Jem  was  the  product  of  their  first  year  of
marriage;  four  years  later  I  was  born,  and  two  years  later  our  mother
died  from  a  sudden  heart  attack.  They  said  it  ran  in  her  family.  I  did
not  miss  her,  but  I  think  Jem  did.  He  remembered  her  clearly,  and
sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off
and  play  by  himself  behind  the  car-house.  When  he  was  like  that,  I
knew better than to bother him.
When  I  was  almost  six  and  Jem  was  nearly  ten,  our  summertime
boundaries  (within  calling  distance  of  Calpurnia)  were  Mrs.  Henry
Lafayette Dubose’s house two doors to the north of us, and the Radley
Place three doors to the south. We were never tempted to break them.

description  of  whom  was  enough  to  make  us  behave  for  days  on  end;
Mrs. Dubose was plain hell.
That was the summer Dill came to us.
Early one morning as we were beginning our day ’s play in the back
yard, Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford ’s
collard  patch.  We  went  to  the  wire  fence  to  see  if  there  was  a  puppy —
Miss  Rachel’s  rat  terrier  was  expecting—instead  we  found  som eone
sitting  looking  at  us.  Sitting  down,  he  wasn ’t  much  higher  than  the
collards. We stared at him until he spoke:
“Hey.”
“Hey yourself,” said Jem pleasantly.
“I’m Charles Baker Harris,” he said. “I can read.”
“So what? ” I said.
“I  just  thought  you’d  like  to  know  I  can  read.  You  got  anything
needs readin’ I can do it....”
“How old are you,” asked Jem, “four-and-a-half?”
“Goin’ on seven.”
“Shoot no wonder, then,” said Jem, jerking his thumb at me.  “Scout
yonder’s  been  readin’  ever  since  she  was  born,  and  she  ain’t  even
started to school yet. You look right puny for goin’ on seven.”
“I’m little but I’m old,” he said.
Jem  brushed  his  hair  back  to  get  a  better  look. “Why  don ’t  you
come over, Charles Baker Harris?” he said. “Lord, what a name.”
“’s  not  any  funnier’n  yours.  Aunt  Rachel  says  your  name’s  Jeremy
Atticus Finch.”
Jem  scowled.  “I’m  big  enough  to  fit  mine, ”  he  said.  “Your  name ’s
longer’n you are. Bet it’s a foot longer.”
“Folks call me Dill,” said Dill, struggling under the fence.
“Do better if you go over it instead of under it,” I said. “Where ’d you
come from?”
Dill  was  from  Meridian,  Mississippi,  was  spending  the  summer
with  his  aunt,  Miss  Rachel,  and  would  be  spending  every  summer  in
M a y c o m b  f r o m  n o w  o n .  H i s  f a m i l y  w a s  f r o m  M a y c o m b  C o u n t y
originally,  his  mother  worked  for  a  photographer  in  Meridian,  had
entered  his  picture  in  a  Beautiful  Child  contest  and  won  five  dollars.
She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times
on it.
“Don’t have  any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the
courthouse sometimes,” said Jem. “Ever see anything good?”
Dill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with
the beginning of respect. “Tell it to us,” he said.
Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his
shirt,  his  hair  was  snow  white  and  stuck  to  his  head  like  duckfluff;  he
was a year my senior but I towered over him. As he told us the old tale
his  blue  eyes  would  lighten  and  darken;  his  laugh  was  sudden  and
happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead.
W h e n  D i l l  r e d u c e d  D r a c u l a  t o  d u s t ,  a n d  J e m  s a i d  t h e  s h o w
sounded  better  than  the  book,  I  asked  Dill  where  his  father  was: “You
ain’t said anything about him.”
“I haven’t got one.”
“Is he dead?”
“No...”
“Then if he’s not dead you’ve got one, haven’t you?”
Dill  blushed  and  Jem  told  me  to  hush,  a  sure  sign  that  Dill  had
been  studied  and  found  acceptable.  Thereafter  the  summer  passed  in
routine contentment. Routine contentment was: improving our
treehouse  that  rested  between  giant  twin  chinaberry  trees  in  the  back
yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas based on the works of
O l i v e r  O p t i c ,  V i c t o r  A p p l e t o n ,  a n d  E d g a r  R i c e  B u r r o u g h s .  I n  t h i s
matter  we  were  lucky  to  have  Dill.  He  played  the  character  parts
formerly  thrust  upon  me—the  ape  in  Tarzan,  Mr.  Crabtree  in  The
Rover Boys, Mr. Damon in Tom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as a
pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans, strange
longings, and quaint fancies.
But  by  the  end  of  August  our  repertoire  was  vapid  from  count less
reproductions, and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo
Radley come out.
The  Radley  Place  fascinated  Dill.  In  spite  of  our  warnings  and
explanations  it  drew  him  as  the  moon  draws  water,  but  drew  him  no
nearer  than  the  light-pole  on  the  corner,  a  safe  distance  from  the
Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole, staring
and wondering.
The  Radley  Place  jutted  into  a  sharp  curve  beyond  our  house.
Walking south, one faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside
the lot. The house was low, was once white with a deep front porch and
green shutters, but had long ago darkened to the color of the slate -gray
yard  around  it.  Rain-rotted  shingles  drooped  over  the  eaves  of  the
v e r a n d a ;  o a k  t r e e s  k e p t  t h e  s u n  a w a y .  T h e  r e m a i n s  o f  a  p i c k e t
d r u n k e n l y  g u a r d e d  t h e  f r o n t  y a r d —a “swept” yard that was never
swept-where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.
I n s i d e  t h e  h o u s e  l i v e d  a  m a l e v o l e n t  p h a n t o m .  P e o p l e  s a i d  h e
existed, but Jem and I had never seen him. People said he went out at
n i g h t  w h e n  t h e  m o o n  w a s  d o w n ,  a n d  p e e p e d  i n  w i n d o w s .  W h e n
people’s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on
them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in Maycomb were his work.
Once  the  town  was  terrorized  by  a  series  of  morbid  nocturnal  events:
people’s  chickens  and  household  pets  were  found  mutilated;  although
t h e  c u l p r i t  w a s  C r a z y  A d d i e ,  w h o  e v e n t u a l l y  d r o w n e d  h i m s e l f  i n
Barker’s  Eddy,  people  still  looked  at  the  Radley  Place,  unwilling  to
discard  their  initial  suspicions.  A  Negro  would  not  pass  the  Radley
Place at night, he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle
as  he  walked.  The  Maycomb  school  grounds  adjoined  the  back  of  the
Radley  lot;  from  the  Radley  chickenyard  tall  pecan  trees  shook  their
fruit  into  the  schoolyard,  but  the  nuts  lay  untouched  by  the  children:
Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a
lost ball and no questions asked.
The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were
born.  The  Radleys,  welcome  anywhere  in  town,  kept  to  themselves,  a
predilection  unforgivable  in  Maycomb.  They  did  not  go  to  church,
Maycomb ’s  principal  recreation,  but  worshiped  at  home;  Mrs.  Radley
seldom  if  ever  crossed  the  street  for  a  mid-morning  coffee  break  with
her  neighbors,  and  certainly  never  joined  a  missionary  circle.  Mr.
Radley  walked  to  town  at  eleven -thirty  every  morning  and  came  back
promptly  at  twelve,  sometimes  carrying  a  brown  paper  bag  that  the
neighborhood  assumed  contained  the  family  groceries.  I  never  knew
how  old  Mr.  Radley  made  his  living —Jem  said  he  “bought  cotton,”  a
polite  term  for  doing  nothing—but  Mr.  Radley  and  his  wife  had  lived
there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember.
T h e  s h u t t e r s  a n d  d o o r s  o f  t h e  R a d l e y  h o u s e  w e r e  c l o s e d  o n
Sundays,  another  thing  alien  to  Maycomb’s  ways:  closed  doors  meant
illness  and  cold  weather  only.  Of  all  days  Sunday  was  the  day  for
formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore corsets, men wore coats, children
wore  shoes.  But  to  climb  the  Radley  front  steps  and  ca ll,  “He-y, ”  of  a
S u n d a y  a f t e r n o o n  w a s  s o m e t h i n g  t h e i r  n e i g h b o r s  n e v e r  d i d .  T h e
Radley  house  had  no  screen  doors.  I  once  asked  Atticus  if  it  ever  had
any; Atticus said yes, but before I was born.
According  to  neighborhood  legend,  when  the  younger  Radley  boy
was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams
from  Old  Sarum,  an  enormous  and  confusing  tribe  domiciled  in  the
northern  part  of  the  county,  and  they  formed  the  nearest  thing  to  a
gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but enough to be discussed
by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they hung around
the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and went
to  the  picture  show;  they  attended  dances  at  the  county’s  riverside
gambling  hell,  the  Dew-Drop  Inn  &   Fishing  Camp;  they  experimented
with stumphole whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell
Mr. Radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd.
One  night,  in  an  excessive  spurt  of  high  spirits,  the  boys  backed
around the square in a borrowed flivv er, resisted  arrest by Maycomb’s
a n c i e n t  b e a d l e ,  M r .  C o n n e r ,  a n d  l o c k e d  h i m  i n  t h e  c o u r t h o u s e
outhouse.  The  town  decided  something  had  to  be  done;  Mr.  Conner
said  he  knew who  each and  every  one  of  them  was, and  he  was  bound
and determined they wouldn’t get away with it, so the boys came before
the  probate  judge  on  charges  of  disorderly  conduct,  disturbing  the
peace,  assault  and  battery,  and  using  abusive  and  profane  language  in
the presence and hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why
he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was
sure every lady in Maycomb heard them. The judge decided to send the
boys to the state industrial school, where boys were sometimes sent for
no  other  reason  than  to  provide  them  with  food  and  dec ent  shelter:  it
was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was. If the
judge  released  Arthur,  Mr.  Radley  would  see  to  it  that  Arthur  gave  no
further  trouble.  Knowing  that  Mr.  Radley’s  word  was  his  bond,  the
judge was glad to do so.
The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best
secondary  education  to  be  had  in  the  state;  one  of  them  eventually
worked  his  way  through  engineering  school  at  Auburn.  The  doors  of
the Radley house were closed on weekdays as well as Sundays, a nd Mr.
Radley’s boy was not seen again for fifteen years.
But  there  came  a  day,  barely  within  Jem ’s  memory,  when  Boo
Radley was heard from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem.
He said Atticus never talked much about the Radleys: when Jem would
question  him  Atticus’s  only  answer  was  for  him  to  mind  his  own
business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a right to; but when
it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, “Mm, mm, mm.”
So  Jem  received  most  of  his  information  from  Miss  Step hanie
Crawford,  a  neighborhood  scold,  who  said  she  knew  the  whole  thing.
According to Miss Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting
some items from The Maycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His
father  entered  the  room.  As  Mr.  Radley  passed  by,  Boo  drove  the
scissors into his parent’s leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his pants,
and resumed his activities.
Mrs.  Radley  ran  screaming  into  the  street  that  Arthur  was  killing
them  all,  but  when  the  sheriff  arrived  he  found  Boo  still  sitting  in the
livingroom, cutting up the Tribune. He was thirty-three years old then.
Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any
asylum,  when  it  was  suggested  that  a  season  in  Tuscaloosa  might  be
helpful to Boo. Boo wasn’t crazy, he was high -strung at times. It was all
right to shut him up, Mr. Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be
charged  with  anything:  he  was  not  a  criminal.  The  sheriff  hadn ’t  the
heart  to  put  him  in  jail  alongside  Negroes,  so  Boo  was  locked  in  the
courthouse basement.
Boo’s  transition  from  the  basement  to  back  home  was  nebulous  in
Jem’s memory. Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council
told Mr. Radley that if he didn ’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold
from the damp. Besides, Boo could not live forever  on the bounty of the
county.
Nobody  knew  what  form  of  intimidation  Mr.  Radley  employed  to
keep  Boo  out  of  sight,  but  Jem  figured  that  Mr.  Radley  kept  him
chained to the bed most of the time. Atticus said no, it wasn ’t that sort
of thing, that there were other ways of making people into ghosts.
My  memory  came  alive  to  see  Mrs.  Radley  occasionally  open  the
front  door,  walk  to  the  edge  of  the  porch,  and  pour  water  on  her
cannas. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. Radley walking to and
from town. He was a t hin leathery man with colorless eyes, so colorless
they  did  not  reflect  light.  His  cheekbones  were  sharp  and  his  mouth
was  wide,  with  a  thin  upper  lip  and  a  full  lower  lip.  Miss  Stephanie
Crawford  said  he  was  so  upright  he  took  the  word  of  God  as  his  only
law,  and  we  believed  her,  because  Mr.  Radley’s  posture  was  ramrod
straight.
He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground
and say,  “Good morning, sir,” a n d  h e  w o u l d  c o u g h  i n  r e p l y .  M r .
Radley’s elder son lived in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and
he  was  one  of  the  few  persons  we  ever  saw  enter  or  leave  the  place.
From  the  day  Mr.  Radley  took  Arthur  home,  people  said  the  house
died.
But  there  came  a  day  when  Atticus  told  us  he ’d  wear  us  out  if  we
made any noise in the yard and comm issioned Calpurnia to serve in his
absence if she heard a sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.
He  took  his  time  about  it.  Wooden  sawhorses  blocked  the  road  at
each end of the Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic
was diverted to the bac k street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of
our  house  and  walked  to  the  Radley ’s  every  time  he  called.  Jem  and  I
crept around the yard for days. At last the sawhorses were taken away,
and we stood watching from the front porch when Mr. Radley made hi s
final journey past our house.
“There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into,”
murmured  Calpurnia,  and  she  spat  meditatively  into  the  yard.  We
looked at her in surprise, for Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways
of white people.
The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would
c o m e  o u t ,  b u t  i t  h a d  a n o t h e r  t h i n k  c o m i n g :  B o o ’s elder brother
returned from Pensacola and took Mr. Radley’s place. The only
difference  between  him  and  his  father  was  their  ages.  Jem  said  Mr.
Nathan  Radley  “bought  cotton,”  too.  Mr.  Nathan  would  speak  to  us,
however,  when  we  said  good  morning,  and  sometimes  we  saw  him
coming from town with a magazine in his hand.
The  more  we  told  Dill  about  the  Radleys,  the  more  he  wanted  to
know, the longer he would stand hugging  the light-pole on the corner,
the more he would wonder.
“Wonder  what  he  does  in  there,”  he  would  murmur.  “Looks  like
he’d just stick his head out the door.”
Jem said, “H e  g o e s  o u t ,  a l l  r i g h t ,  w h e n  i t ’s pitch dark. Miss
Stephanie  Crawford  said  she  woke  up in  the  middle  of  the  night  one
time and saw him looking straight through the window at her... said his
head  was  like  a  skull  lookin’  at  her.  Ain ’t  you  ever  waked  up  at  night
and heard him, Dill? He walks like this—” Jem slid his feet through the
gravel.  “Why  do  you  think  Miss  Rachel  locks  up  so  tight  at  night?  I ’ve
seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin’, and one night I heard
him  scratching  on  the  back  screen,  but  he  was  gone  time  Atticus  got
there.”
“Wonder what he looks like?” said Dill.
Jem  gave  a  reasonable  description  of  Boo:  Boo  was  about  six-and-
a-half  feet  tall,  judging  from  his  tracks;  he  dined  on  raw  squirrels  and
any cats he could catch, that’s why his hands were bloodstained—if you
ate  an  animal  raw,  you  could  never  wash  the  blood  off.  T here  was  a
long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth he had were yellow
and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.
“Let’s try to make him come out, ” said Dill.  “I’d like to see what he
looks like.”
Jem said if Dill wanted to  get himself killed, all he had to do was go
up and knock on the front door.
Our  first  raid  came  to  pass  only  because  Dill  bet  Jem  The  Gray
Ghost  against  two  Tom  Swifts  that  Jem  wouldn ’t  get  any  farther  than
the Radley gate. In all his life, Jem had never declined a dare.
Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more
than his head, for Dill wore him down easily: “You’re scared,” Dill said,
the first day. “Ain ’t scared, just respectful,” Jem said. The next day Dill
said, “You ’re too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard. ” Jem
said  he  reckoned  he  wasn ’t,  he’d  passed  the  Radley  Place  every  school
day of his life.
“Always runnin’,” I said.
But  Dill  got  him  the  third  day,  when  he  told  Jem  that  folks  in
Meridian certainly weren’t as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that he ’d
never seen such scary folks as the ones in Maycomb.
This  was  enough  to  make  Jem  march  to  the  corner,  where  he
stopped  and  leaned  against  the  light -pole,  watching  the  gate  hanging
crazily on its homemade hinge.
“I  hope  you’ve  got  it  through  your  head  that  he ’ll  kill  us  each  and
every  one,  Dill  Harris,”  said  Jem,  when  we  joined  him. “Don’t  blame
me when he gouges your eyes out. You started it, remember.”
“You’re still scared,” murmured Dill patiently.
Jem  wanted  Dill  to  know  once  and  for  all  that  he  wasn ’t  scared  of
anything:  “It’s  just  that  I  can ’t  think  of  a  way  to  make  him  come  out
without him gettin’ us.” Besides, Jem had his little sister to think of.
When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little si ster to
think of the time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: “If I got
killed,  what’d  become  of  you?”  he  asked.  Then  he  jumped,  landed
unhurt, and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the
Radley Place.
“You gonna run out on a dare?” asked Dill. “If you are, then—”
“Dill,  you  have  to  think  about  these  things,”  Jem  said.  “Lemme
think a minute... it’s sort of like making a turtle come out...”
“How’s that?” asked Dill.

 And Then There Were None

  CHAPTER 1

  IN THE CORNER of a first-class smoking carriage, Mr. Justice Wargrave,
 lately retired from the bench, puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye
 through the political news in the Times.
  He laid the paper down and glanced out of the window. They were running now
  through Somerset. He glanced at his watch-another two hours to go.  He went
 over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about Indian Island.
 There had been its original purchase by an American millionaire who was crazy
  about yachting-and an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on
 this  little island off the Devon coast. The unfortunate fact that the new
 third wife  of the American millionaire was a bad sailor had led to the
 subsequent putting  up of the house and island for sale. Various glowing
 advertisements of it had  appeared in the papers. Then came the first bald
 statement that it had been  bought-by a Mr. Owen. After that the rurnours
 of the gossip writers had started.  Indian Island had really been bought by
 Miss Gabrielle Turl, the Hollywood film  star! She wanted to spend some
 months there free from all publicity! Busy Bee had  hinted delicately that
 it was to be an abode for Royalty??! Mr. Merryweather had  had it whispered
 to him that it had been bought for a honeymoon-Young Lord L-- had
 surrendered to Cupid at last! Jonas knew for a fact that it had been
 purchased by the Admiralty with a view to carrying out some very hush hush
  experiments!
  Definitely, Indian Island was news!
  From his pocket Mr. Justice Wargrave drew out a letter. The handwriting was
  practically illegible but words here and there stood out with unexpected
 clarity.  Dearest Lawrence . . . such years since I heard anything of you
 . . . must come  to Indian Island . . . the most enchanting place . . . so
 much to talk over . .  . old days . . . communion with Nature . . . bask
 in sunshine . . . 12.40 from Paddington . . . meet you at Oakbridge . . .
 and his correspondent signed herself with
 a flourish his ever Constance Culmington.
  Mr. Justice Wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had
 last  seen Lady Constance Culmington. It must be seven -no, eight years ago.
 She had  then been going to Italy to bask in the sun and be at one with
 Nature and the  contaditd. Later, he had heard, she had proceeded to Syria
 where she proposed to  bask in yet stronger sun and live at one with Nature
 and the bedouin.  Constance Culmington, he reflected to himself, was exactly
 the sort of woman who  would buy an island and surround herself with
 mystery! Nodding his head in gentle  approval of his logic, Mr. Justice
 Wargrave allowed his head to nod. He slept. . . .

  Vera Claythorne, in a third-class carriage with five other travellers in
 it,  leaned her head back and shut her eyes. How hot it was travelling by
 train  to-day! It would be nice to get to the sea! Really a great piece of
 luck getting  this job. When you wanted a holiday post it nearly always
 meant looking after a  swarm of children-secretarial holiday posts were much
 more difficult to get. Even  the agency hadn't held out much hope.
  And then the letter had come.

  "I have received your name from the Skilled Women's Agency together with
 their  recommendation. I understand they know you personally. I shall be
 glad to pay you  the salary you ask and shall expect you to take up your
 duties on August 8th. The  train is the 12.40 from Paddington and you will
 be met at Oakbridge station. I  enclose five pound notes for expenses.

  Yours truly,
  Una Nancy Owen."

  And at the top was the stamped address Indian Island, Sticklehaven, Devon.
 . . .
  Indian Island! Why, there had been nothing else in the papers lately! All
  sorts of hints and interesting rumours. Though probably

  that was mostly untrue. But the house had certainly been built by a
 millionaire and was said to be absolutely the last word in luxury.
  Vera Claythorne, tired by a recent strenuous term at school, thought to
 herself-"Being a games mistress in a third-class school isn't much of a
 catch. school."
  And then, with a cold feeling round her heart, she thought: "But I'm lucky
 to  have even this. After all, people don't like a Coroner's Inquest, even
 if the  Coroner did acquit me of all blame!"
  He had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage, she
 remembered.  For an inquest it couldn't have gone better. And Mrs. Hamilton
 had been kindness  itself to her- Only Hugo(but she wouldn't think of Hugo!)
  Suddenly, in spite of the heat in the carriage she shivered and wished she
 wasn't  going to the sea. A picture rose clearly before her mind. Cyril's
 head, bobbing  up and down, swimming to the rock. . . . Up and down-up and
 down. . . . And  herself, swimming in easy practised strokes after him-
 cleaving her way through  the water but knowing, only too surely, that she
 wouldn't be in time. . . .  The sea-its deep warm blue-mornings spent lying
 out on the sands-Hugo-Hugo who  had said he loved her.
  She must not think of Hugo. . . .
  She opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her. A tall man
 with  a brown face, light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant
 almost cruel  mouth.
  She thought to herself:
  "I bet he's been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some
 interesting  things

 If only I could get a job at some decent

  Philip Lombard, summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of
  his quick moving eyes thought to himself:
  "Quite attractive-a bit schoolmistressy perhaps.
  A cool customer, he should imagine-and one who could hold her
  own-in love or war. He'd rather like to take her on. . . .
  He frowned. No, cut out all that kind of stuff. This was business. He'd got
 to  keep his mind on the job.

  What exactly was up, he wondered? That little Jew had been damned
 mysterious.  "Take it or leave it, Captain Lombard."
  He had said thoughtfully:
  "A hundred guineas, eh?"
  He had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to
 him.  A hundred guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal!
 He had  fancied, though, that the little Jew had not been deceived-that was
 the damnable  part about Jews, you couldn't deceive them about money-they
 knewlHe had said in the same casual tone:
  "And you can't give me any further information?"
  Mr. Isaac Morris had shaken his little bald head very positively.
  "No, Captain Lombard, the matter rests there. It is understood by my client
 that  your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place. I am empowered
 to hand  you one hundred guineas in return for which you will travel to
 Sticklehaven,  Devon. The nearest station is Oakbridge, you will be met
 there and motored to  Sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to
 Indian Island. There you  will hold yourself at the disposal of my client."
  Lombard had said abruptly:
  "For how long?"
  "Not longer than a week at most."
  Fingering his small moustache, Captain Lombard said:
  "You understand I can't undertake anything-illegal?"

  In  a  dream,  silently,  she  had  come  to  him,  her  wasted
  body  within  its  loose  graveclothes  giving  off  an  odour  of
  wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute
  secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
  Her  glazing  eyes,  staring  out  of  death,  to  shake  and
  bend my soul. On me alone. The ghostcandle to light her
  agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Her hoarse loud

  Her  eyes  on  me  to  strike  me  down.  Liliata  rutilantium  te

  trembling  at  his  soul’s  cry,  heard  warm  running  sunlight
  and in the air behind him friendly words.
  —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is
  ready. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. It’s all
  right.
  —I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.

  Four quid? Lend us one.

  In  the  gloomy  domed  livingroom  of  the  tower  Buck
  Mulligan’s  gowned  form  moved  briskly  to  and  fro  about
  the  hearth,  hiding  and  revealing  its  yellow  glow.  Two
  shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the
  high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
  coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
  —We’ll  be  choked,  Buck  Mulligan  said.  Haines,  open
  that door, will you?
  Stephen  laid  the  shavingbowl  on  the  locker.  A  tall
  figure  rose  from  the  hammock  where  it  had  been  sitting,
  went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.
  —Have you the key? a voice asked.
  —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m
  choked!
  He howled, without looking up from the fire:
  —Kinch!
  —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.

  The  key  scraped  round  harshly  twice  and,  when  the
  heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air
  entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.
  Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down
  to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
  him.  Then  he  carried  the  dish  and  a  large  teapot  over  to
  the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.
  —I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ...
  But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake
  up!  Bread,  butter,  honey.  Haines,  come  in.  The  grub  is
  ready.  Bless  us,  O  Lord,  and  these  thy  gifts.  Where’s  the
  sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.
  Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the
  buttercooler from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a
  sudden pet.
  —What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come
  after eight.
  —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s
  a lemon in the locker.
  —O,  damn  you  and  your  Paris  fads!  Buck  Mulligan
  said. I want Sandycove milk.
  Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
  —That woman is coming up with the milk.
  Ulysses

  —The  blessings  of  God  on  you!  Buck  Mulligan  cried,
  jumping  up  from  his  chair.  Sit  down.  Pour  out  the  tea
  there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can’t go fumbling at
  the damned eggs.
  He  hacked  through  the  fry  on  the  dish  and  slapped  it
  out on three plates, saying:
  —In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
  Haines sat down to pour out the tea.
  —I’m  giving  you  two  lumps  each,  he  said.  But,  I  say,
  Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?
  Buck  Mulligan,  hewing  thick  slices  from  the  loaf,  said
  in an old woman’s wheedling voice:
  —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan
  said. And when I makes water I makes water.
  —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
  Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
  —So  I  do,  Mrs  Cahill,  says  she.  Begob,  ma’am,  says  Mrs
  Cahill, God send you don’t make them in the one pot.
  He  lunged  towards  his  messmates  in  turn  a  thick  slice
  of bread, impaled on his knife.
  —That’s  folk,  he  said  very  earnestly,  for  your  book,
  Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the
  folk  and  the  fishgods  of  Dundrum.  Printed  by  the  weird
  sisters in the year of the big wind.
  Ulysses
  21 of 1305
  He  turned  to  Stephen  and  asked  in  a  fine  puzzled
  voice, lifting his brows:
  —Can  you  recall,  brother,  is  mother  Grogan’s  tea  and
  water  pot  spoken  of  in  the  Mabinogion  or  is  it  in  the
  Upanishads?
  —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
  —Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.
  Your reasons, pray?
  —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or
  out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one
  imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
  Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.
  —Charming!  he  said  in  a  finical  sweet  voice,  showing
  his  white  teeth  and  blinking  his  eyes  pleasantly.  Do  you
  think she was? Quite charming!
  Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he
  growled  in  a  hoarsened  rasping  voice  as  he  hewed  again
  vigorously at the loaf:
  —For old Mary Ann
   She doesn’t care a damn.
   But, hising up her petticoats ...
  He  crammed  his  mouth  with  fry  and  munched  and
  droned.
  Ulysses

  The doorway was darkened by an entering form.
  —The milk, sir!
  —Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
  An  old  woman  came  forward  and  stood  by  Stephen’s
  elbow.
  —That’s  a  lovely  morning,  sir,  she  said.  Glory  be  to
  God.
  —To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be
  sure!
  Stephen  reached  back  and  took  the  milkjug  from  the
  locker.
  —The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak
  frequently of the collector of prepuces.
  —How much, sir? asked the old woman.
  —A quart, Stephen said.
  He watched her pour into the measure and thence into
  the jug rich white milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She
  poured  again  a  measureful  and  a  tilly.  Old  and  secret  she
  had  entered  from  a  morning  world,  maybe  a  messenger.
  She  praised  the  goodness  of  the  milk,  pouring  it  out.
  Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a
  witch  on  her  toadstool,  her  wrinkled  fingers  quick  at  the
  squirting  dugs.  They  lowed  about  her  whom  they  knew,
  dewsilky  cattle.  Silk  of  the  kine  and  poor  old  woman,
  Ulysses
  23 of 1305
  names  given  her  in  old  times.  A  wandering  crone,  lowly
  form  of  an  immortal  serving  her  conqueror  and  her  gay
  betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the
  secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could
  not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
  —It  is  indeed,  ma’am,  Buck  Mulligan  said,  pouring
  milk into their cups.
  —Taste it, sir, she said.
  He drank at her bidding.
  —If  we  could  live  on  good  food  like  that,  he  said  to
  her  somewhat  loudly,  we  wouldn’t  have  the  country  full
  of  rotten  teeth  and  rotten  guts.  Living  in  a  bogswamp,
  eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust,
  horsedung and consumptives’ spits.
  —Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
  —I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.
  —Look at that now, she said.
  Stephen  listened  in  scornful  silence.  She  bows  her  old
  head  to  a  voice  that  speaks  to  her  loudly,  her  bonesetter,
  her  medicineman:  me  she  slights.  To  the  voice  that  will
  shrive  and  oil  for  the  grave  all  there  is  of  her  but  her
  woman’s  unclean  loins,  of  man’s  flesh  made  not  in  God’s
  likeness,  the  serpent’s  prey.  And  to  the  loud  voice  that
  now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
  Ulysses

  —Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
  —Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said
  to Haines.
  Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
  —Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
  —I  thought  it  was  Irish,  she  said,  by  the  sound  of  it.
  Are you from the west, sir?
  —I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
  —He’s  English,  Buck  Mulligan  said,  and  he  thinks  we
  ought to speak Irish in Ireland.
  —Sure  we  ought  to,  the  old  woman  said,  and  I’m
  ashamed I don’t speak the language myself. I’m told it’s a
  grand language by them that knows.
  —Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.
  Wonderful  entirely.  Fill  us  out  some  more  tea,  Kinch.
  Would you like a cup, ma’am?
  —No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the
  ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.
  Haines said to her:
  —Have you your bill? We had better pay her,
  Mulligan, hadn’t we?
  Stephen filled again the three cups.
  —Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a
  pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence
  Ulysses
  25 of 1305
  over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three
  quarts is a shilling. That’s a shilling and one and two is two
  and two, sir.
  Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with
  a  crust  thickly  buttered  on  both  sides,  stretched  forth  his
  legs and began to search his trouser pockets.
  —Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him,
  smiling.
  Stephen  filled  a  third  cup,  a  spoonful  of  tea  colouring
  faintly  the  thick  rich  milk.  Buck  Mulligan  brought  up  a
  florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:
  —A miracle!
  He  passed  it  along  the  table  towards  the  old  woman,
  saying:
  —Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I
  give.
  Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
  —We’ll owe twopence, he said.
  —Time  enough,  sir,  she  said,  taking  the  coin.  Time
  enough. Good morning, sir.
  She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck
  Mulligan’s tender chant:

  had  been  appointed  to  a  sub-committee  of  a  sub-
  committee  which  had  sprouted  from  one  of  the
  innumerable committees dealing with minor
  difficulties  that  arose  in  the  compilation  of  the
  Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary.
  They  were  engaged  in  producing  something  called
  an  Interim  Report,  but  what  it  was  that  they  were
  reporting  on  he  had  never  definitely  found  out.  It
  was  something  to  do  with  the  question  of  whether
  commas should be placed inside brackets, or
  outside.  There  were  four  others  on  the  committee,
  all  of  them  persons  similar  to  himself.  There  were
  days when they assembled and then promptly
  dispersed  again,  frankly  admitting  to  one  another
  that  there  was  not  really  anything  to  be  done.  But
  there  were  other  days  when  they  settled  down  to
  their  work  almost  eagerly,  making  a  tremendous
  show of entering up their minutes and drafting long
  memoranda  which  were  never  finished—when  the
  argument as to what they were supposedly arguing
  about  grew  extraordinarily  involved  and  abstruse,
  with  subtle  haggling  over  definitions,  enormous
  digressions,  quarrels—threats,  even,  to  appeal  to
  higher authority. And then suddenly the life would
  go  out  of  them  and  they  would  sit  round  the  table
  looking at one another with extinct eyes, like
  ghosts fading at cock-crow.
  trabajaba  un  poco,  si  a  aquello  podía  llamársele
  trabajo. Había sido nombrado miembro de un
  subcomit  de  otro  subcomit  que  dependía  de  uno
  de  los  innumerables  subcomits  que  se  ocupaban
  de las dificultades de menos importancia
  planteadas por la preparación de la onceava edición
  del  Diccionario  de  Neolengua.  En  aquel  despacho
  se dedicaban a redactar algo que llamaban el
  informe provisional, pero Winston nunca había
  llegado  a  enterarse  de  qu  tenían  que  informar.
  Tenía  alguna  relación  con  la  cuestión  de  si  las
  comas  deben  ser  colocadas  dentro  o  fuera  de  las
  comillas. Había otros cuatro en el subcomit, todos
  en  situación  semejante  a  la  de  Winston.  Algunos
  días se marchaban apenas se habían reunido
  despus  de  reconocer  sinceramente  que  no  había
  nada que hacer. Pero otros días se ponían a trabajar
  casi con encarnizamiento haciendo grandes alardes
  de  aprovechamiento  del  tiempo  redactando  largos
  informes que nunca terminaban. En esas ocasiones
  discutían sobre cual era el asunto sobre cuya
  discusión se les había encargado  y esto les llevaba
  a  complicadas  argumentaciones  y  sutiles  distingos
  con  interminables  digresiones,  peleas,  amenazas  e
  incluso recurrían a las autoridades superiores. Pero
  de pronto parecía retirárselas la vida y se quedaban
  inmóviles  en  torno  a  la  mesa  mirándose  unos  a
  otros  con  ojos  apagados  como  fantasmas  que  se
  esfuman con el canto del gallo.

  The  telescreen  was  silent  for  a  moment.  Winston
  raised  his  head  again.  The  bulletin!  But  no,  they
  were  merely  changing  the  music.  He  had  the  map
  of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the
  armies was a diagram: a black arrow tearing
  vertically southward, and a white arrow
  horizontally eastward, across the tail of the first. As
  though for reassurance he looked up at the
  imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it
  conceivable  that  the  second  arrow  did  not  even
  exist?
  La telepantalla estuvo un momento silenciosa.
  Winston levantó la cabeza otra vez. ¡El
  comunicado! Pero no, sólo era un cambio de
  música.  Tenía  el  mapa  de  África  detrás  de  los
  párpados,  el  movimiento  de  los  ejrcitos  que  l
  imaginaba era este diagrama; una flecha negra
  dirigindose verticalmente hacia el Sur y una
  flecha blanca en dirección horizontal, hacia el Este,
  cortando  la  cola  de  la  primera.  Como  para  darse
  ánimos,  miró  el  imperturbable  rostro  del  retrato.
  ¿Podía concebirse que la segunda flecha no
  existiera?

  His interest flagged again. He drank another
  mouthful  of  gin,  picked  up  the  white  knight  and
  made a tentative move. Check. But it was evidently
  not the right move, because—
  Volvió  a  aflojársela  el  inters.  Bebió  más  ginebra,
  cogió  la  pieza  blanca  e  hizo  un  intento  de  jugada.
  Pero no era aqulla la jugada acertada, porque...


  George Orwell 1 9 8 4


  334
  Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw
  a  candle-lit  room  with  a  vast  white-counterpaned
  bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the
  floor,  shaking  a  dice-box,  and  laughing  excitedly.
  His mother was sitting opposite him and also
  laughing.
  Sin  quererlo,  le  flotó  en  la  memoria  un  recuerdo.
  Vio  una  habitación  iluminada  por  la  luz  de  una
  vela  con  una  gran  cama  de  madera  clara  y  l,  un
  chico  de  nueve  o  diez  años  que  estaba  sentado  en
  el  suelo  agitando  un  cubilete  de  dados  y  rindose
  excitado.  Su  madre  estaba  sentada  frente  a  l  y
  tambin se reía.


  It must have been about a month before she
  disappeared.  It  was  a  moment  of  reconciliation,
  when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten
  and  his  earlier  affection  for  her  had  temporarily
  revived.  He  remembered  the  day  well,  a  pelting,
  drenching  day  when  the  water  streamed  down  the
  window-pane  and  the  light  indoors  was  too  dull  to
  read  by.  The  boredom  of  the  two  children  in  the
  dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable.
  Winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands
  for food, fretted about the room pulling everything
  out  of  place  and  kicking  the  wainscoting  until  the
  neighbours  banged  on  the  wall,  while  the  younger
  child  wailed  intermittently.  In  the  end  his  mother
  said,  ‘Now  be  good,  and  I’ll  buy  you  a  toy.  A
  lovely  toy—you’ll  love  it’;  and  then  she  had  gone
  out  in  the  rain,  to  a  little  general  shop  which  was
  still sporadically open nearby, and came back with
  a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and
  Ladders.  He  could  still  remember  the  smell  of  the
  damp  cardboard.  It  was  a  miserable  outfit.  The
  board  was  cracked  and  the  tiny  wooden  dice  were
  so  ill-cut  that  they  would  hardly  lie  on  their  sides.
  Winston  looked  at  the  thing  sulkily  and  without
  interest.  But  then  his  mother  lit  a  piece  of  candle
  and  they  sat  down  on  the  floor  to  play.  Soon  he
  was  wildly  excited  and  shouting  with  laughter  as
  the  tiddly-winks  climbed  hopefully  up  the  ladders
  and  then  came  slithering  down  the  snakes  again,
  almost to the starting-point. They played eight
  games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too
  young to understand what the game was about, had
  sat  propped  up  against  a  bolster,  laughing  because
  the  others  were  laughing.  For  a  whole  afternoon
  they  had  all  been  happy  together,  as  in  his  earlier
  childhood.
  Aquello debió de ocurrir un mes antes de
  desaparecer ella. Fueron unos momentos de
  reconciliación en que Winston no sentía aquel
  hambre imperiosa y le había vuelto temporalmente
  el  cariño  por  su  madre.  Recordaba  bien  aquel  día,
  un día húmedo de lluvia continua. El agua
  chorreaba monótona por los cristales de las
  ventanas  y  la  luz  del  interior  era  demasiado  dbil
  para  leer.  El  aburrimiento  de  los  dos  niños  en  la
  triste habitación era insoportable. Winston
  gimoteaba, pedía inútilmente que le dieran de
  comer,  recorría  la  habitación  revolvindolo  todo  y
  dando  patadas  hasta  que  los  vecinos  tuvieron  que
  protestar.  Mientras,  su  hermanita  lloraba  sin  parar.
  Al final le dijo su madre: «S bueno y te comprar
  un  juguete.  Sí,  un  juguete  precioso  que  te  gustará
  mucho». Y había salido a pesar de la lluvia para ir
  a unos almacenes que estaban abiertos a esa hora y
  volvió con una caja de cartón conteniendo el juego
  llamado  «De  las  serpientes  y  las  escaleras».  Era
  muy modesto. El cartón estaba rasgado y los
  pequeños  dados  de  madera,  tan  mal  cortados  que
  apenas  se  sostenían.  Winston  recordaba  el  olor  a
  humedad del cartón. Había mirado el juego de mal
  humor.  No  le  interesaba  gran  cosa.  Pero  entonces
  su  madre  encendió  una  vela  y  se  sentaron  en  el
  suelo  a  jugar.  Jugaron  ocho  veces  ganando  cuatro
  cada  uno.  La  hermanita,  demasiado  pequeña  para
  comprender  de  qu  trataba  el  juego,  miraba  y  se
  reía porque los veía reír a ellos dos. Habían pasado
  la  tarde  muy  contentos,  como  cuando  l  era  más
  pequeño.

  He  pushed  the  picture  out  of  his  mind.  It  was  a
  false  memory.  He  was  troubled  by  false  memories
  occasionally.  They  did  not  matter  so  long  as  one
  Apartó  de  su  mente  estas  imágenes.  Era  un  falso
  recuerdo.  De  vez  en  cuando  le  asaltaban  falsos
  recuerdos. Esto no importaba mientras que se

  knew  them  for  what  they  were.  Some  things  had
  happened, others had not happened. He turned back
  to  the  chessboard  and  picked  up  the  white  knight
  again.  Almost  in  the  same  instant  it  dropped  on  to
  the board with a clatter. He had started as though a
  pin had run into him.
  supiera lo que era. Winston volvió a fijar la
  atención  en  el  tablero  de  ajedrez,  pero  casi  en  el
  mismo  instante  dio  un  salto  como  si  lo  hubieran
  pinchado con un alfiler.



  A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the
  bulletin!  Victory!  It  always  meant  victory  when  a
  trumpet-call  preceded  the  news.  A  sort  of  electric
  drill  ran  through  the  cafe.  Even  the  waiters  had
  started and pricked up their ears.
  Un agudo trompetazo perforó el aire. Era el
  comunicado, ¡victoria!; siempre significaba
  victoria  la  llamada  de  la  trompeta  antes  de  las
  noticias. Una especie de corriente elctrica recorrió
  a  todos  los  que  se  hallaban  en  el  caf.  Hasta  los
  camareros se sobresaltaron y aguzaron el oído.

  The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume
  of  noise.  Already  an  excited  voice  was  gabbling
  from  the  telescreen,  but  even  as  it  started  it  was
  almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside.
  The news had run round the streets like magic.  He
  could  hear  just  enough  of  what  was  issuing  from
  the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as
  he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had
  secretly  assembled  a  sudden  blow  in  the  enemy’s
  rear,  the  white  arrow  tearing  across  the  tail  of  the
  black. Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed
  themselves through the din: ‘Vast strategic
  manoeuvre—perfect co-ordination—utter rout—
  half a million prisoners—complete
  demoralization—control  of  the  whole  of  Africa—
  bring  the  war  within  measurable  distance  of  its
  end—victory—greatest victory in human history—
  victory, victory, victory!’
  La trompeta había dado paso a un enorme volumen
  de ruido. Una voz excitada gritaba en la
  telepantalla, pero apenas había empezado fue
  ahogada  por  una  espantosa  algarabía  en  las  calles.
  La  noticia  se  había  difundido  como  por  arte  de
  magia.  Winston  había  oído  lo  bastante  para  saber
  que todo había sucedido como l lo había previsto:
  una inmensa armada, reunida secretamente, un
  golpe  repentino  a  la  retaguardia  del  enemigo,  la
  flecha blanca destrozando la cola de la flecha
  negra.  Entre  el  estruendo  se  destacaban  trozos  de
  frases  triunfales:  «Amplia  maniobra  estratgica...
  perfecta coordinación... tremenda derrota medio
  millón de prisioneros... completa
  desmoralización... controlamos el África entera. La
  guerra  se  acerca  a  su  final...  victoria...  la  mayor
  victoria  en  la  historia  de  la  Humanidad.  ¡Victoria,
  victoria, victoria!».

  Under  the  table  Winston’s  feet  made  convulsive
  movements. He had not stirred from his seat, but in
  his  mind  he  was  running,  swiftly  running,  he  was
  with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He
  looked up again at the portrait of Big Brother. The
  colossus  that  bestrode  the  world!  The  rock  against
  which  the  hordes  of  Asia  dashed  themselves  in
  vain!  He  thought  how  ten  minutes  ago—yes,  only
  ten  minutes—there  had  still  been  equivocation  in
  his  heart  as  he  wondered  whether  the  news  from
  the  front  would  be  of  victory  or  defeat.  Ah,  it  was
  more than a Eurasian army that had perished!
  Much had changed in him since that first day in the
  Ministry of Love, but the final, indispensable,
  healing change had never happened, until this

  APPENDIX

  The Principles of Newspeak

  Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of
  Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his
  sole  means  of  communication,  either  in  speech  or  writing.  The  leading  articles  in  ‘The  Times’  were
  written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could only be carried out by a specialist. It was
  expected  that  Newspeak  would  have  finally  superseded  Oldspeak  (or  Standard  English,  as  we  should
  call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use
  Newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The version
  in  use  in  1984,  and  embodied  in  the  Ninth  and  Tenth  Editions  of  the  Newspeak  Dictionary,  was  a
  provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be
  suppressed  later.  It  is  with  the  final,  perfected  version,  as  embodied  in  the  Eleventh  Edition  of  the
  Dictionary, that we are concerned here.


  The  purpose  of  Newspeak  was  not  only  to  provide  a  medium  of  expression  for  the  world-view  and
  mental habits proper to the devotees of  Ingsoc, but to make  all other modes of thought impossible.  It
  was  intended  that  when  Newspeak  had  been  adopted  once  and  for  all  and  Oldspeak  forgotten,  a
  heretical  thought—that  is,  a  thought  diverging  from  the  principles  of  Ingsoc—should  be  literally
  unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words.  Its vocabulary was so  constructed  as to
  give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish
  to express, while excluding  all other meanings  and also the possibility of  arriving at them by indirect
  methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable
  words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all
  secondary  meanings  whatever.  To  give  a  single  example.  The  word  FREE  still  existed  in  Newspeak,
  but it could only be used in such statements as ‘This dog is free from lice’ or ‘This field is free from
  weeds’.  It  could  not  be  used  in  its  old  sense  of  ‘politically  free’  or  ‘intellectually  free’  since  political
  and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.
  Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as
  an  end  in  itself,  and  no  word  that  could  be  dispensed  with  was  allowed  to  survive.  Newspeak  was
  designed not to extend but to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted
  by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.


  Newspeak  was  founded  on  the  English  language  as  we  now  know  it,  though  many  Newspeak
  sentences, even when not containing newly-created words, would be barely intelligible to an English-
  speaker  of  our  own  day.  Newspeak  words  were  divided  into  three  distinct  classes,  known  as  the  A
  vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler
  to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in
  the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.


  THE  A  VOCABULARY.  The  A  vocabulary  consisted  of  the  words  needed  for  the  business  of
  everyday  life—for  such  things  as  eating,  drinking,  working,  putting  on  one’s  clothes,  going  up  and
  down  stairs,  riding  in  vehicles,  gardening,  cooking,  and  the  like.  It  was  composed  almost  entirely  of
  words that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE, FIELD—but in

  comparison  with  the  present-day  English  vocabulary  their  number  was  extremely  small,  while  their
  meanings were far more rigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of
  them.  So  far  as  it  could  be  achieved,  a  Newspeak  word  of  this  class  was  simply  a  staccato  sound
  expressing  ONE  clearly  understood  concept.  It  would  have  been  quite  impossible  to  use  the  A
  vocabulary  for  literary  purposes  or  for  political  or  philosophical  discussion.  It  was  intended  only  to
  express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.

  The  grammar  of  Newspeak  had  two  outstanding  peculiarities.  The  first  of  these  was  an  almost
  complete interchangeability between different parts of speech. Any word in the language (in principle
  this  applied  even  to  very  abstract  words  such  as  IF  or  WHEN)  could  be  used  either  as  verb,  noun,
  adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was
  never  any  variation,  this  rule  of  itself  involving  the  destruction  of  many  archaic  forms.  The  word
  THOUGHT,  for  example,  did  not  exist in  Newspeak.  Its  place  was  taken  by  THINK,  which  did  duty
  for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original
  noun  that  was  chosen  for  retention,  in  other  cases  the  verb.  Even  where  a  noun  and  verb  of  kindred
  meaning  were  not  etymologically  connected,  one  or  other  of  them  was  frequently  suppressed.  There
  was,  for  example,  no  such  word  as  CUT,  its  meaning  being  sufficiently  covered  by  the  noun-verb
  KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix —FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding
  —WISE. Thus for example, SPEEDFUL meant ‘rapid’ and SPEEDWISE meant ‘quickly’. Certain of
  our  present-day  adjectives,  such  as  GOOD,  STRONG,  BIG,  BLACK,  SOFT,  were  retained,  but  their
  total number was very small. There was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could
  be arrived at by adding —FUL to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except
  for a very few already ending in —WISE: the —WISE termination was invariable. The word WELL,
  for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.


  In  addition,  any  word—this  again  applied  in  principle  to  every  word  in  the  language—could  be
  negatived  by  adding  the  affix  UN-,  or  could  be  strengthened  by  the  affix  PLUS-,  or,  for  still  greater
  emphasis,  DOUBLEPLUS-.  Thus,  for  example,  UNCOLD  meant  ‘warm’,  while  PLUSCOLD  and
  DOUBLEPLUSCOLD  meant,  respectively,  ‘very  cold’  and  ‘superlatively  cold’.  It  was  also  possible,
  as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as
  ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-, etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous
  diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no need for such a word as
  BAD, since the required meaning was equally well—indeed, better—expressed by UNGOOD. All that
  was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which of
  them  to  suppress.  DARK,  for  example,  could  be  replaced  by  UNLIGHT,  or  LIGHT  by  UNDARK,
  according to preference.


  The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions
  which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and
  the  past  participle  were  the  same  and  ended  in  —ED.  The  preterite  of  STEAL  was  STEALED,  the
  preterite  of  THINK  was  THINKED,  and  so  on  throughout  the  language,  all  such  forms  as  SWAM,
  GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by adding —S or
  —ES as the case might be. The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison
  of adjectives was invariably made by adding —ER, —EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST), irregular
  forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.


  The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives,
  George Orwell 1 9 8 4


  339
  the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except
  that WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had been dropped,
  all  their  uses  being  covered  by  WILL  and  WOULD.  There  were  also  certain  irregularities  in  word-
  formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was
  liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally therefore, for the sake
  of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But this need
  made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was attached
  to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.

  THE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately
  constructed  for  political  purposes:  words,  that  is  to  say,  which  not  only  had  in  every  case  a  political
  implication,  but  were  intended  to  impose  a  desirable  mental  attitude  upon  the  person  using  them.
  Without a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. In
  some  cases  they  could  be  translated  into  Oldspeak,  or  even  into  words  taken  from  the  A  vocabulary,
  but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. The B
  words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at
  the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language.


  The B words  were in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as SPEAKWRITE,  were of
  course  to  be  found  in  the  A  vocabulary,  but  these  were  merely  convenient  abbreviations  and  had  no
  special  ideological  colour.]  They  consisted  of  two  or  more  words,  or  portions  of  words,  welded
  together  in  an  easily  pronounceable  form.  The  resulting  amalgam  was  always  a  noun-verb,  and
  inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the word GOODTHINK, meaning,
  very roughly, ‘orthodoxy’, or, if one chose to regard it as a verb, ‘to think in an orthodox manner’. This
  inflected  as  follows:  noun-verb,  GOODTHINK;  past  tense  and  past  participle,  GOODTHINKED;
  present  participle,  GOOD-THINKING;  adjective,  GOODTHINKFUL;  adverb,  GOODTHINKWISE;
  verbal noun, GOODTHINKER.


  The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of which they were made up
  could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made
  them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),
  for  instance,  the  THINK  came  second,  whereas  in  THINKPOL  (Thought  Police)  it  came  first,  and  in
  the  latter  word  POLICE  had  lost  its  second  syllable.  Because  of  the  great  difficulty  in  securing
  euphony,  irregular  formations  were  commoner  in  the  B  vocabulary  than  in  the  A  vocabulary.  For
  example, the adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,
  MINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply because —TRUEFUL, -PAXFUL,
  and  —LOVEFUL  were  slightly  awkward  to  pronounce.  In  principle,  however,  all  B  words  could
  inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way.


  Some  of  the  B  words  had  highly  subtilized  meanings,  barely  intelligible  to  anyone  who  had  not
  mastered  the  language  as  a  whole.  Consider,  for  example,  such  a  typical  sentence  from  a  ‘Times’
  leading article as OLDTHINKERS UNBELLYFEEL  INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could
  make  of  this  in  Oldspeak  would  be:  ‘Those  whose  ideas  were  formed  before  the  Revolution  cannot
  have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism.’ But this is not an adequate
  translation. To begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above,
  one  would  have  to  have  a  clear  idea  of  what  is  meant  by  INGSOC.  And  in  addition,  only  a  person
  thoroughly  grounded  in  Ingsoc  could  appreciate  the  full  force  of  the  word  BELLYFEEL,  which

  George Orwell 1 9 8 4
  340
  implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word OLDTHINK, which
  was  inextricably  mixed  up  with  the  idea  of  wickedness  and  decadence.  But  the  special  function  of
  certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one, was not so much to express meanings as to
  destroy  them.  These  words,  necessarily  few  in  number,  had  had  their  meanings  extended  until  they
  contained  within  themselves  whole  batteries  of  words  which,  as  they  were  sufficiently  covered  by  a
  single  comprehensive  term,  could  now  be  scrapped  and  forgotten.  The  greatest  difficulty  facing  the
  compilers  of  the  Newspeak  Dictionary  was  not  to  invent  new  words,  but,  having  invented  them,  to
  make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they cancelled by their
  existence.
  As  we  have  already  seen  in  the  case  of  the  word  FREE,  words  which  had  once  borne  a  heretical
  meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings
  purged out of them. Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY,
  INTERNATIONALISM,  DEMOCRACY,  SCIENCE,  and  RELIGION  had  simply  ceased  to  exist.  A
  few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words grouping
  themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word
  CRIMETHINK, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism
  were  contained  in  the  single  word  OLDTHINK.  Greater  precision  would  have  been  dangerous.  What
  was  required  in  a  Party  member  was  an  outlook  similar  to  that  of  the  ancient  Hebrew  who  knew,
  without  knowing  much  else,  that  all  nations  other  than  his  own  worshipped  ‘false  gods’.  He  did  not
  need  to  know  that  these  gods  were  called  Baal,  Osiris,  Moloch,  Ashtaroth,  and  the  like:  probably  the
  less  he  knew  about  them  the  better  for  his  orthodoxy.  He  knew  Jehovah  and  the  commandments  of
  Jehovah:  he  knew,  therefore,  that  all  gods  with  other  names  or  other  attributes  were  false  gods.  In
  somewhat  the  same  way,  the  party  member  knew  what  constituted  right  conduct,  and  in  exceedingly
  vague,  generalized  terms  he  knew  what  kinds  of  departure  from  it  were  possible.  His  sexual  life,  for
  example,  was  entirely  regulated  by  the  two  Newspeak  words  SEXCRIME  (sexual  immorality)  and
  GOODSEX  (chastity).  SEXCRIME  covered  all  sexual  misdeeds  whatever.  It  covered  fornication,
  adultery,  homosexuality,  and  other  perversions,  and,  in  addition,  normal  intercourse  practised  for  its
  own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and,
  in  principle,  all  punishable  by  death.  In  the  C  vocabulary,  which  consisted  of  scientific  and  technical
  words,  it  might  be  necessary  to  give  specialized  names  to  certain  sexual aberrations,  but  the  ordinary
  citizen  had  no  need  of  them.  He  knew  what  was  meant  by  GOODSEX—that  is  to  say,  normal
  intercourse  between  man  and  wife,  for  the  sole  purpose  of  begetting  children,  and  without  physical
  pleasure  on  the  part  of  the  woman:  all  else  was  SEXCRIME.  In  Newspeak  it  was  seldom  possible  to
  follow  a  heretical  thought  further  than  the  perception  that  it  WAS  heretical:  beyond  that  point  the
  necessary words were nonexistent.
  No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were euphemisms. Such words,
  for  instance,  as  JOYCAMP  (forced-labour  camp)  or  MINIPAX  (Ministry  of  Peace,  i.e.  Ministry  of
  War) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,
  displayed  a frank and  contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example
  was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out
  to the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation ‘good’ when applied to the
  Party and ‘bad’ when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of words which
  at  first  sight  appeared  to  be  mere  abbreviations  and  which  derived  their  ideological  colour  not  from
  their meaning, but from their structure.
  So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was
  fitted  into  the  B  vocabulary.  The  name  of  every  organization,  or  body  of  people,  or  doctrine,  or
  George Orwell 1 9 8 4
  341
  country,  or  institution,  or  public  building,  was  invariably  cut  down  into  the  familiar  shape;  that  is,  a
  single  easily  pronounced  word  with  the  smallest number  of  syllables  that  would  preserve  the  original
  derivation.  In  the  Ministry  of  Truth,  for  example,  the  Records  Department,  in  which  Winston  Smith
  worked,  was  called  RECDEP,  the  Fiction  Department  was  called  FICDEP,  the  Teleprogrammes
  Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time.
  Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the
  characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use
  abbreviations  of  this  kind  was  most  marked  in  totalitarian  countries  and  totalitarian  organizations.
  Examples  were  such  words  as  NAZI,  GESTAPO,  COMINTERN,  INPRECORR,  AGITPROP.  In  the
  beginning  the  practice  had  been  adopted  as  it  were  instinctively,  but  in  Newspeak  it  was  used  with  a
  conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered
  its  meaning,  by  cutting  out  most  of  the  associations  that  would  otherwise  cling  to  it.  The  words
  COMMUNIST  INTERNATIONAL,  for  instance,  call  up  a  composite  picture  of  universal  human
  brotherhood,  red  flags,  barricades,  Karl  Marx,  and  the  Paris  Commune.  The  word  COMINTERN,  on
  the  other  hand,  suggests  merely  a  tightly-knit  organization  and  a  well-defined  body  of  doctrine.  It
  refers  to  something  almost  as  easily  recognized,  and  as  limited  in  purpose,  as  a  chair  or  a  table.
  COMINTERN  is  a  word  that  can  be  uttered  almost  without  taking  thought,  whereas  COMMUNIST
  INTERNATIONAL is a  phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily.  In the same
  way, the associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more controllable than those
  called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever
  possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily
  pronounceable.
  In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of
  grammar  was  always  sacrificed  to  it  when  it  seemed  necessary.  And  rightly  so,  since  what  was
  required,  above  all  for  political  purposes,  was  short  clipped  words  of  unmistakable  meaning  which
  could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker’s mind. The words of
  the  B  vocabulary  even  gained  in  force  from  the  fact  that  nearly  all  of  them  were  very  much  alike.
  Almost invariably these words—GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP,
  INGSOC,  BELLYFEEL,  THINKPOL,  and  countless  others—were  words  of  two  or  three  syllables,
  with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a
  gabbling  style  of  speech,  at  once  staccato  and  monotonous.  And  this  was exactly  what  was  aimed  at.
  The  intention  was  to  make  speech,  and  especially  speech  on  any  subject  not  ideologically  neutral,  as
  nearly  as  possible  independent  of  consciousness.  For  the  purposes  of  everyday  life  it  was  no  doubt
  necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to make
  a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a
  machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost
  foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness
  which was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.
  So  did  the  fact  of  having  very  few  words  to  choose  from.  Relative  to  our  own,  the  Newspeak
  vocabulary  was  tiny,  and  new  ways  of  reducing  it  were  constantly  being  devised.  Newspeak,  indeed,
  differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year.
  Each  reduction  was  a  gain,  since  the  smaller  the  area  of  choice,  the  smaller  the  temptation  to  take
  thought. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the
  higher  brain  centres  at  all.  This  aim  was  frankly  admitted  in  the  Newspeak  word  DUCKSPEAK,
  meaning  ‘to  quack  like  a  duck’.  Like  various  other  words  in  the  B  vocabulary,  DUCKSPEAK  was
  ambivalent  in  meaning.  Provided  that  the  opinions  which  were  quacked  out  were  orthodox  ones,  it
  implied  nothing  but  praise,  and  when  ‘The  Times’  referred  to  one  of  the  orators  of  the  Party  as  a
  George Orwell 1 9 8 4
  342
  DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.
  THE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of
  scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scientific terms in use today, and were constructed
  from the same roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable
  meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies. Very
  few  of  the  C  words  had  any  currency  either  in  everyday  speech  or  in  political  speech.  Any  scientific
  worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality, but he
  seldom  had  more  than  a  smattering  of  the  words  occurring  in  the  other  lists.  Only  a  very  few  words
  were common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a habit of
  mind,  or  a  method  of  thought,  irrespective  of  its  particular  branches.  There  was,  indeed,  no  word  for
  ‘Science’,  any  meaning  that  it  could  possibly  bear  being  already  sufficiently  covered  by  the  word
  INGSOC.
  From  the  foregoing  account  it  will  be  seen  that  in  Newspeak  the  expression  of  unorthodox  opinions,
  above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very
  crude kind, a species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say BIG BROTHER
  IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity,
  could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available.
  Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named
  in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining
  them  in  doing  so.  One  could,  in  fact,  only  use  Newspeak  for  unorthodox  purposes  by  illegitimately
  translating  some  of  the  words  back  into  Oldspeak.  For  example,  ALL  MANS  ARE  EQUAL  was  a
  possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a
  possible  Oldspeak  sentence.  It  did  not  contain  a  grammatical  error,  but  it  expressed  a  palpable
  untruth—i.e.  that  all  men  are  of  equal  size,  weight,  or  strength.  The  concept  of  political  equality  no
  longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged  out of the word EQUAL.  In
  1984,  when  Oldspeak  was  still  the  normal  means  of  communication,  the  danger  theoretically  existed
  that  in  using  Newspeak  words  one  might  remember  their  original  meanings.  In  practice  it  was  not
  difficult for any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within a couple of
  generations  even  the  possibility  of  such  a  lapse  would  have  vanished.  A  person  growing  up  with
  Newspeak  as  his  sole  language  would  no  more  know  that  EQUAL  had  once  had  the  secondary
  meaning  of  ‘politically  equal’,  or  that  FREE  had  once  meant  ‘intellectually  free’,  than  for  instance,  a
  person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to QUEEN
  and ROOK. There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit,
  simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be foreseen that with the
  passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more
  pronounced—its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance
  of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.
  When  Oldspeak  had  been  once  and  for  all  superseded,  the  last  link  with  the  past  would  have  been
  severed.  History  had  already  been  rewritten,  but  fragments  of  the  literature  of  the  past  survived  here
  and  there,  imperfectly  censored,  and  so  long  as  one  retained  one’s  knowledge  of  Oldspeak  it  was
  possible  to  read  them.  In  the  future  such  fragments,  even  if  they  chanced  to  survive,  would  be
  unintelligible and untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak
  unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action, or was already
  orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak expression) in tendency. In practice this meant
  that  no  book  written  before  approximately  1960  could  be  translated  as  a  whole.  Pre-revolutionary

  The WannaCry ransomware attack was a worldwide cyberattack in May 2017 by the WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.[5] It propagated through EternalBlue, an exploit developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for older Windows systems. EternalBlue was stolen and leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers at least a year prior to the attack. While Microsoft had released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's spread was from organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows systems that were past their end-of-life. These patches were imperative to an organization's cyber-security but many were not applied because of neglect, ignorance, mismanagement, or a misunderstanding about their importance. Some have claimed a need for 24/7 operation, aversion to risking having formerly working applications breaking because of patch changes, lack of personnel or time to install them, or other reasons.

  The attack began at 07:44 UTC on May 12th 2017 and was halted a few hours later at 15:03 UTC by the registration of a kill switch discovered by Marcus Hutchins. The kill switch prevented already infected computers from being encrypted or further spreading WannaCry. [6] The attack was estimated to have affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country.

  In December 2017, the United States and United Kingdom formally asserted that North Korea was behind the attack.

  A new variant of WannaCry forced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to temporarily shut down several of its chip-fabrication factories in August 2018. The virus spread to 10,000 machines in TSMC's most advanced facilities.
  WannaCry is a ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting (locking) data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The worm is also known as WannaCrypt,[9] Wana Decrypt0r 2.0,[10] WanaCrypt0r 2.0,[11] and Wanna Decryptor.[12] It is considered a network worm because it also includes a transport mechanism to automatically spread itself. This transport code scans for vulnerable systems, then uses the EternalBlue exploit to gain access, and the DoublePulsar tool to install and execute a copy of itself.[13] WannaCry versions 0, 1, and 2 were created using Microsoft Visual C 6.0.[14]

  EternalBlue is an exploit of Microsoft's implementation of their Server Message Block (SMB) protocol released by The Shadow Brokers. Much of the attention and comment around the event was occasioned by the fact that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) (from whom the exploit was likely stolen) had already discovered the vulnerability, but used it to create an exploit for its own offensive work, rather than report it to Microsoft.[15][16] Microsoft eventually discovered the vulnerability, and on Tuesday, 14 March 2017, they issued security bulletin MS17-010, which detailed the flaw and announced that patches had been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time, these being Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016.[17]

  DoublePulsar is a backdoor tool, also released by The Shadow Brokers on 14 April 2017. Starting from 21 April 2017, security researchers reported that there were tens of thousands of computers with the DoublePulsar backdoor installed.[18] By 25 April, reports estimated that the number of infected computers could be up to several hundred thousand, with numbers increasing every day.[19][20] The WannaCry code can take advantage of any existing DoublePulsar infection, or installs it itself.[13][21][22] On 9 May 2017, private cybersecurity company RiskSense released code on GitHub with the stated purpose of allowing legal white hat penetration testers to test the CVE-2017-0144 exploit on unpatched systems.

  When executed, the WannaCry malware first checks the kill switch domain name; if it is not found, then the ransomware encrypts the computer's data,[23][24][25] then attempts to exploit the SMB vulnerability to spread out to random computers on the Internet,[26] and laterally to computers on the same network.[27] As with other modern ransomware, the payload displays a message informing the user that their files have been encrypted, and demands a payment of around US300 in bitcoin within three days, or US600 within seven days,[24][28] warning that "you have not so enough time." Three hardcoded bitcoin addresses, or wallets, are used to receive the payments of victims. As with all such wallets, their transactions and balances are publicly accessible even though the cryptocurrency wallet owners remain unknown.[29]

  Several organizations released detailed technical writeups of the malware, including a senior security analyst at RiskSense,[30][31] Microsoft,[32] Cisco,[13] Malwarebytes,[26] Symantec and McAfee.[27]
  The attack began on Friday, 12 May 2017,[33][34] with evidence pointing to an initial infection in Asia at 07:44 UTC.[33][35] The initial infection was likely through an exposed vulnerable SMB port,[36] rather than email phishing as initially assumed.[33] Within a day the code was reported to have infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries.[37][38]

Organizations that had not installed Microsoft's security update from April 2017 were affected by the attack.[39] Those still running unsupported versions of Microsoft Windows, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003[40][41] were at particularly high risk because no security patches had been released since April 2014 for Windows XP (with the exception of one emergency patch released in May 2014) and July 2015 for Windows Server 2003.[9] A Kaspersky Lab study reported, however, that less than 0.1 percent of the affected computers were running Windows XP, and that 98 percent of the affected computers were running Windows 7.[9][42] In a controlled testing environment, the cybersecurity firm Kryptos Logic found that it was unable to infect a Windows XP system with WannaCry using just the exploits, as the payload failed to load, or caused the operating system to crash rather than actually execute and encrypt files. However, when executed manually, WannaCry could still operate on Windows XP.[43][44][45] Linguistic analysis of the ransom notes indicated the authors were likely fluent in Chinese[81] and proficient in English, as the versions of the notes in those languages were probably human-written while the rest seemed to be machine-translated.[82][83] According to an analysis by the FBI's Cyber Behavioral Analysis Center, the computer that created the ransomware language files had Hangul language fonts installed, as evidenced by the presence of the "fcharset129" Rich Text Format tag.[14] Metadata in the language files also indicated that the computers that created the ransomware were set to UTC09:00, used in Korea.[14]

A Google security researcher[84][85] initially posted a tweet[86] referencing code similarities between WannaCry and previous malware. The cybersecurity companies[87] Kaspersky Lab and Symantec have both said the code has some similarities with that previously used by the Lazarus Group[88] (believed to have carried out the cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and a Bangladesh bank heist in 2016—and linked to North Korea).[88] This could also be either simple re-use of code by another group[89] or an attempt to shift blame—as in a cyber false flag operation;[88] but a leaked internal NSA memo is alleged to have also linked the creation of the worm to North Korea.[90] Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said he believed North Korea was the originator of the WannaCry attack,[91] and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre reached the same conclusion.[92]

On 18 December 2017, the United States Government formally announced that it publicly considers North Korea to be the main culprit behind the WannaCry attack.[93] President Trump's Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal about this charge, saying "We do not make this allegation lightly. It is based on evidence."[94] In a press conference the following day, Bossert said that the evidence indicates that Kim Jong-un had given the order to launch the malware attack.[95] Bossert said that Canada, New Zealand and Japan agree with the United States' assessment of the evidence that links the attack to North Korea,[96] while the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office says it also stands behind the United States' assertion.[97]

North Korea, however, denied being responsible for the cyberattack.[98][99]

On 6 September 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced formal charges against Park Jin-hyok for involvement in the Sony Pictures hack of 2014. The DoJ contended that Park was a North Korean hacker working as part of a team of experts for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The Department of Justice asserted this team also had been involved in the WannaCry attack, among other activities.[100][101]
The ransomware campaign was unprecedented in scale according to Europol,[37] which estimates that around 200,000 computers were infected across 150 countries. According to Kaspersky Lab, the four most affected countries were Russia, Ukraine, India and Taiwan.[103]

One of the largest agencies struck by the attack was the National Health Service hospitals in England and Scotland,[104][105] and up to 70,000 devices  including computers, MRI scanners, blood-storage refrigerators and theatre equipment  may have been affected.[106] On 12 May, some NHS services had to turn away non-critical emergencies, and some ambulances were diverted.[107][108] In 2016, thousands of computers in 42 separate NHS trusts in England were reported to be still running Windows XP.[40] In 2018 a report by Members of Parliament concluded that all 200 NHS hospitals or other organizations checked in the wake of the WannaCry attack still failed cybersecurity checks.[109][110] NHS hospitals in Wales and Northern Ireland were unaffected by the attack.[111][107]

Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK in Tyne and Wear, England, halted production after the ransomware infected some of their systems. Renault also stopped production at several sites in an attempt to stop the spread of the ransomware.[112][113] Spain's Telefónica, FedEx and Deutsche Bahn were hit, along with many other countries and companies worldwide.[114][115][116]

The attack's impact is said to be relatively low compared to other potential attacks of the same type and could have been much worse had Hutchins not discovered that a kill switch had been built in by its creators[117][118] or if it had been specifically targeted on highly critical infrastructure, like nuclear power plants, dams or railway systems.[119][120]

According to cyber-risk-modeling firm Cyence, economic losses from the cyber attack could reach up to US4 billion, with other groups estimating the losses to be in the hundreds of millions.[121]
A number of experts highlighted the NSA's non-disclosure of the underlying vulnerability, and their loss of control over the EternalBlue attack tool that exploited it. Edward Snowden said that if the NSA had "privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, the attack may not have happened".[165] British cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley also sees "some culpability on the part of the U.S. intelligence services". According to him and others "they could have done something ages ago to get this problem fixed, and they didn't do it". He also said that despite obvious uses for such tools to spy on people of interest, they have a duty to protect their countries' citizens.[166] Others have also commented that this attack shows that the practice of intelligence agencies to stockpile exploits for offensive purposes rather than disclosing them for defensive purposes may be problematic.[118] Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote, "Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen."[167][168][169] Russian President Vladimir Putin placed the responsibility of the attack on U.S. intelligence services, for having created EternalBlue.[154]

On 17 May 2017, United States bipartisan lawmakers introduced the PATCH Act[170] that aims to have exploits reviewed by an independent board to "balance the need to disclose vulnerabilities with other national security interests while increasing transparency and accountability to maintain public trust in the process".[171]

On 15 June 2017, the United States Congress was to hold a hearing on the attack.[172] Two subpanels of the House Science Committee were to hear the testimonies from various individuals working in the government and non-governmental sector about how the US can improve its protection mechanisms for its systems against similar attacks in the future.[172]

Marcus Hutchins, a cybersecurity researcher, working in loose collaboration with UK's National Cyber Security Centre,[173][174] researched the malware and discovered a "kill switch".[55] Later globally dispersed security researchers collaborated online to develop open source tools[175][176] that allow for decryption without payment under some circumstances.[177] Snowden states that when "NSA-enabled ransomware eats the Internet, help comes from researchers, not spy agencies" and asks why this is the case.[178][179][174]

Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated that "the patching and updating systems are broken, basically, in the private sector and in government agencies".[118] In addition, Segal said that governments' apparent inability to secure vulnerabilities "opens a lot of questions about backdoors and access to encryption that the government argues it needs from the private sector for security".[118] Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), stated that "the current attacks show how vulnerable our digital society is. It's a wake-up call for companies to finally take IT security [seriously]".[180]
United Kingdom

The effects of the attack also had political implications; in the United Kingdom, the impact on the National Health Service quickly became political, with claims that the effects were exacerbated by Government underfunding of the NHS; in particular, the NHS ceased its paid Custom Support arrangement to continue receiving support for unsupported Microsoft software used within the organization, including Windows XP.[181] Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused to say whether patient data had been backed up, and Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth accused Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of refusing to act on a critical note from Microsoft, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the National Crime Agency that had been received two months previously.[182]

Others argued that hardware and software vendors often fail to account for future security flaws, selling systems that  due to their technical design and market incentives  eventually won't be able to properly receive and apply patches.[183]

The NHS denied that it was still using XP, claiming only 4.7 of devices within the organization ran Windows XP.[184][43] The cost of the attack to the NHS was estimated as £92 million in disruption to services and IT upgrades.[185]

After the attack, NHS Digital refused to finance the estimated £1 billion to meet the Cyber Essentials Plus standard, an information security certification organized by the UK NCSC, saying this would not constitute "value for money", and that it had invested over £60 million and planned "to spend a further £150 [million] over the next two years" to address key cyber security weaknesses.[186]
Crime and Punishment
On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young 
man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place
and  walked  slowly,  as  though  in  hesitation,  towards  K.
bridge.
He  had  successfully  avoided  meeting  his  landlady  on
the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-
storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room.
The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and
attendance,  lived  on  the  floor  below,  and  every  time  he
went  out  he  was  obliged  to  pass  her  kitchen,  the  door  of
which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the
young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him
scowl  and  feel  ashamed.  He  was  hopelessly  in  debt  to  his
landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite
the  contrary;  but  for  some  time  past  he  had  been  in  an
overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria.
He  had  become  so  completely  absorbed  in  himself,  and
isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only
his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty,
but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh
upon  him.  He  had  given  up  attending  to  matters  of
practical  importance;  he  had  lost  all  desire  to  do  so.
Nothing  that  any  landlady  could  do  had  a  real  terror  for
him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen
to  her  trivial,  irrelevant  gossip,  to  pestering  demands  for
payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for
excuses,  to  prevaricate,  to  lie—no,  rather  than  that,  he
would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.
This evening, however, on coming out into the street,
he became acutely aware of his fears.
‘I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by
these trifles,’ he thought, with an odd smile. ‘Hm ... yes,
all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice,
that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is
men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new
word  is  what  they  fear  most....  But  I  am  talking  too
much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps
it  is  that  I  chatter  because  I  do  nothing.  I’ve  learned  to
chatter  this  last  month,  lying  for  days  together  in  my  den
thinking  ...  of  Jack  the  Giant-killer.  Why  am  I  going
there  now?  Am  I  capable  of  that?  Is  that  serious?  It  is  not
serious  at  all.  It’s  simply  a  fantasy  to  amuse  myself;  a
plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.’
The  heat  in  the  street  was  terrible:  and  the  airlessness,
the  bustle  and  the  plaster,  scaffolding,  bricks,  and  dust  all
about  him,  and  that  special  Petersburg  stench,  so  familiar
to  all  who  are  unable  to  get  out  of  town  in  summer—all
worked painfully upon the young man’s already
overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-
houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the
town,  and  the  drunken  men  whom  he  met  continually,
although  it  was  a  working  day,  completed  the  revolting
misery  of  the  picture.  An  expression  of  the  profoundest
disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined
face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above
the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark
eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep
thought,  or  more  accurately  speaking  into  a  complete
blankness  of  mind;  he  walked  along  not  observing  what
was about him and not caring to observe it. From time to
time,  he  would  mutter  something,  from  the  habit  of
talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these
moments  he  would  become  conscious  that  his  ideas  were
sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two
days he had scarcely tasted food.
He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to
shabbiness  would  have  been  ashamed  to  be  seen  in  the
street  in  such  rags.  In  that  quarter  of  the  town,  however,
scarcely  any  shortcoming  in  dress  would  have  created
surprise.  Owing  to  the  proximity  of  the  Hay  Market,  the
number of establishments of bad character, the
preponderance of the trading and working class population
crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of
Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets
that no figure, however queer, would have caused
surprise.  But  there  was  such  accumulated  bitterness  and
contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the
fastidiousness  of  youth,  he  minded  his  rags  least  of  all  in
the  street.  It  was  a  different  matter  when  he  met  with
acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom,
indeed,  he  disliked  meeting  at  any  time.  And  yet  when  a
drunken man who, for some unknown  reason,  was  being
taken  somewhere  in  a  huge  waggon  dragged  by  a  heavy
dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: ‘Hey
there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice and
pointing  at  him—the  young  man  stopped  suddenly  and
clutched  tremulously  at  his  hat.  It  was  a  tall  round  hat
from  Zimmerman’s,  but  completely  worn  out,  rusty  with
age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side
in  a  most  unseemly  fashion.  Not  shame,  however,  but
quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.
‘I  knew  it,’  he  muttered  in  confusion,  ‘I  thought  so!
That’s  the  worst  of  all!  Why,  a  stupid  thing  like  this,  the
